Examination of Centrality in a Health Social Network	E-HEALTH - FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	25th European Medical Informatics Conference (MIE)	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2014	Istanbul, TURKEY			Social Network Analysis; Centrality Analysis; Health Information Platform; Patient Experience		Growing importance of health information platforms are acknowledges in recent studies. Such platforms are subject to discussion about an extent to which social network characteristics are realized. The platform under examination indeed demonstrates social network peculiarities. In this work, we explore the nature of centrality in one of the leading health information networks in Europe. Among other findings, we identify two nodes (representing patient and physician) are as the most important people in the network in terms of structural analysis Egregiously, these nodes are connected with the other types only and exhibit worth noticing connection patterns. These connections have been discussed along with a medication advice seeking behavior.

J	Levula, A; Wilson, A; Harre, M				Levula, Andrew; Wilson, Andrew; Harre, Michael			The association between social network factors and mental health at different life stages	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Mental health; Social network; Social isolation; Emotional status; Life stages	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; LABOR DYNAMICS; OLDER-ADULTS; SF-36; TIES; LONELINESS; HOUSEHOLD; AUSTRALIA; MORTALITY; SUPPORT	Psychosocial factors are important determinants of an individual's health. This study examines the association between health scores and social network factors on mental health across different life stages. Data were drawn from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey for adolescents (n = 1739), adults (n = 10,309) and seniors (n = 2287). Hierarchical regression modelling was applied to examine effects within and across age groups. All the variables were derived from the self-completion questionnaire. The social network factors were statistically significant predictors of mental health outcomes for all three life stages. For adolescents, the three social network factors were statistically significant with social isolation having the largest impact (beta = -.284, p < .001), followed by social connection (beta = .084, p < .001) and social trust having a similar effect (beta = .073, p < .001). For adults social isolation had the highest impact (beta = -.203, p < .001), followed by social connection (beta = .110, p < .001) and social trust (beta = .087, p < .001).The results for seniors were social isolation (beta = -.188, p < .001), social connection (beta = .147, p < .001) and social trust (beta = .032, p < .05). After adding the social network factors, the models improved significantly with social isolation playing the most significant role across all life stages, whereas the other social network factors played a differentiated role depending upon the life stage. These findings have practical implications in the design of mental health interventions across different life stages.

J	Blanchet, K; James, P				Blanchet, Karl; James, Philip			How to do (or not to do) ... a social network analysis in health systems research	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Health systems research; health systems; research methods; social networks; social sciences	OPINION LEADERS; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; CAPACITY; INFORMATION; RESILIENCE; PREVENTION; PRINCIPLES; CENTRALITY	The main challenges in international health are to scale up effective health interventions in low- and middle-income countries in order to reach a higher proportion of the population. This can be achieved through better insight into how health systems are structured. Social network analysis can provide an appropriate and innovative paradigm for the health systems researcher, allow new analyses of the structure of health systems, and facilitate understanding of the role of stakeholders within a health system. The social network analysis methodology adapted to health systems research and described in detail by the authors comprises three main stages: (i) describing the set of actors and members of the network; (ii) characterizing the relationships between actors; and (iii) analysing the structure of the systems. Evidence generated through social network analysis could help policy makers to understand how health systems react over time and to better adjust health programmes and innovations to the capacities of health systems in low- and middle-income countries to achieve universal coverage.

Social networks in patients hospitalized with preventable conditions for heart disease and diabetes in Hawai'i by health literacy	CHRONIC ILLNESS			English	Article; Early Access						Social networks; ambulatory care sensitive conditions; Native Hawaiians; Pacific Islanders; chronic disease; diabetes; heart disease; medications		Objectives Reducing potentially preventable hospitalizations (PPH) for chronic disease is a research and practice priority. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHOPI) have disparities in PPH, and are understudied in both health literacy and social network research. Greater inclusion of social and familial networks can help address health disparities among people with chronic illness and enhance culturally relevant healthcare. Methods Adults hospitalized with a heart disease or diabetes-related PHH in Hawai'i (N = 22) were assessed for health literacy and social network membership ("alters"). Results Sixty-nine percent of respondents were NHOPI. Three respondents (14%) had no alters ("isolates"). Among non-isolates, 79% desired the participation of at least one alter in chronic disease management-related interventions. Fifty-nine percent of respondents had low health literacy. While the mean number of alters did not vary significantly by health literacy, those with lower health literacy had a trend (p = .055) towards less interest in social network engagement. Discussion In a sample primarily comprised of NHOPI with chronic disease, many patients wished to include social network members in interventions. Engagement varied by health literacy with implications for health disparities. Not all patients were interested in social network engagement, which must be considered in intervention planning.

Utilizing Social Networking Sites to Promote Adolescents' Health A Pragmatic Review of the Literature	CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING			English	Article						Adolescent; Health promotion; Social networking sites	COLLEGE-STUDENTS; MENTAL-HEALTH; DEPRESSION DISCLOSURES; OLDER ADOLESCENTS; SAFETY EDUCATION; SEXUAL HEALTH; YOUNG-ADULTS; INTERNET USE; LOW-INCOME; FACEBOOK	Social networking site use has exploded among youth in the last few years and is being adapted as an important tool for healthcare interventions and serving as a platform for adolescents to gain access to health information. The aim of this study was to examine the strengths, weaknesses, and best practices of utilizing Facebook in adolescent health promotion and research via pragmatic literature review. We also examine how sites can facilitate ethically sound healthcare for adolescents, particularly at-risk youth. We conducted a literature review of health and social sciences literature from the past 5 years related to adolescent health and social network site use. Publications were grouped by shared content then categorized by themes. Five themes emerged: access to healthcare information, peer support and networking, risk and benefits of social network site use in care delivery, overcoming technological barriers, and social network site interventions. More research is needed to better understand how such Web sites can be better utilized to provide access to adolescents seeking healthcare. Given the broad reach of social network sites, all health information must be closely monitored for accurate, safe distribution. Finally, consent and privacy issues are omnipresent in social network sites, which calls for standards of ethical use.

The study employs the techniques of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and statistical modeling to identify the changes in patterns of interaction over time and test associated structural network effects. SNA results indicate overall low participation in the network, although some participants became active over time and even led discussions. In particular, the analysis has shown that a change of lead contributor results in a change in learning interaction and network structure. The analysis of structural network effects demonstrates that the interaction dynamics slow down over time, indicating that interactions in the network are more stable. The health professionals may be reluctant to share knowledge and collaborate in groups but were interested in building personal learning networks or simply seeking information.

By employing a network science perspective, this research is aimed to understand an information network establishing connections among and between information seekers and providers. We found that such a connection network surfaces most of the essential characteristics of a typical complex network. Furthermore, a detailed structural analysis shows some intriguing relations and connection behaviours in the network. Implications of the findings are discussed from the perspectives of medical informatics and social network analysis.

J	Tasselli, S				Tasselli, Stefano			Social Networks of Professionals in Health Care Organizations: A Review	MEDICAL CARE RESEARCH AND REVIEW			English	Review						social networks; health care professionals; knowledge transfer; performance; network dynamics	PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES; COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; WORK; INNOVATION; DIFFUSION; LEADERS; TIES; TECHNOLOGY; NURSE	In this article, we provide an overview of social network research in health care, with a focus on social interactions between professionals in organizations. We begin by introducing key concepts defining the social network approach, including network density, centrality, and brokerage. We then review past and current research on the antecedents of health care professionals' social networksincluding demographic attributes, professional groups, and organizational arrangementsand their consequencesincluding satisfaction at work, leadership, behaviors, knowledge transfer, diffusion of innovation, and performance. Finally, we examine future directions for social network research in health care, focusing on micro-macro linkages and network dynamics.

We introduce an ontology-driven approach towards social network analysis through encoding social data and inferring new information from the data. Methods The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) ontology is a lightweight social network ontology. We enriched FOAF by deriving social interaction data and relationships from social data to extend its domain scope. Results Our effort produced Friend of a Friend with Benefits (FOAF+) ontology that aims to support the spectrum of human interaction. A preliminary semiotic evaluation revealed a semantically rich and comprehensive knowledge base to represent complex social network relationships. With Semantic Web Rules Language, we demonstrated FOAF+ potential to infer social network ties between individual data. Conclusion Using logical rules, we defined interpersonal dyadic social connections, which can create inferred linked dyadic social representations of individuals, represent complex behavioral information, help machines interpret some of the concepts and relationships involving human interaction, query network data, and contribute methods for analytical and disease surveillance.

J	Ostovari, M; Steele-Morris, CJ; Griffin, PM; Yu, D				Ostovari, Mina; Steele-Morris, Charlotte-Joy; Griffin, Paul M.; Yu, Denny			Data-driven modeling of diabetes care teams using social network analysis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						diabetes care; collaboration; social network analysis	PATIENT-SHARING NETWORKS; ORDER PHARMACY USE; PHYSICIAN NETWORKS; HEALTH; COORDINATION; COLLABORATION; REHABILITATION; PROFESSIONALS; CONTINUITY; PATTERNS	Objective: We assess working relationships and collaborations within and between diabetes health care provider teams using social network analysis and a multi-scale community detection. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of claims data from a large employer over 2 years was performed. The study cohort contained 827 patients diagnosed with diabetes. The cohort received care from 2567 and 2541 health care providers in the first and second year, respectively. Social network analysis was used to identify networks of health care providers involved in the care of patients with diabetes. A multi-scale community detection was applied to the network to identify groups of health care providers more densely connected. Social network analysis metrics identified influential providers for the overall network and for each community of providers. Results: Centrality measures identified medical laboratories and mail-order pharmacies as the central providers for the 2 years. Seventy-six percent of the detected communities included primary care physicians, and 97% of the communities included specialists. Pharmacists were detected as central providers in 24% of the communities. Discussion: Social network analysis measures identified the central providers in the network of diabetes health care providers. These providers could be considered as influencers in the network that could enhance the implication of promotion programs through their access to a large number of patients and providers. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides multi-scale metrics for assessing care team relationships. These metrics can be used by implementation experts to identify influential providers for care interventions and by health service researchers to determine impact of team relationships on patient outcomes.

Theoretical approaches of online social network interventions and implications for behavioral change: a systematic review	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Review						behavioral change; health intervention; health psychology; online social network; social cognitive theory; social media	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SUPPORT; IMPACT; MODEL; COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE; DECISIONS	Rational, aims and objectivesThe aim of this review was to identify general theoretical frameworks used in online social network interventions for behavioral change. To address this research question, a PRISMA-compliant systematic review was conducted. MethodsA systematic review (PROSPERO registration number CRD42014007555) was conducted using 3 electronic databases (PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Embase). Four reviewers screened 1788 abstracts. Results15 studies were selected according to the eligibility criteria. Randomized controlled trials and controlled studies were assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias tool, and narrative synthesis. Five eligible articles used the social cognitive theory as a framework to develop interventions targeting behavioral change. Other theoretical frameworks were related to the dynamics of social networks, intention models, and community engagement theories. Only one of the studies selected in the review mentioned a well-known theory from the field of health psychology. ConclusionConclusions were that guidelines are lacking in the design of online social network interventions for behavioral change. Existing theories and models from health psychology that are traditionally used for in situ behavioral change should be considered when designing online social network interventions in a health care setting.

However, designing successful social network interventions is a considerable research challenge. In this study, we rely on social network analysis and agent-based simulations to better understand and capitalize on the complex interplay of social networks and health behaviors. More specifically, we investigate criteria for selecting influence agents that can be expected to produce the most successful social network health interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to test which selection criterion to determine influence agents in a social network intervention resulted in the biggest increase in physical activity in the social network. To test the differences among the selection criteria, a computational model was used to simulate different social network interventions and observe the intervention's effect on the physical activity of primary and secondary school children within their school classes. As a next step, this study relied on the outcomes of the simulated interventions to investigate whether social network interventions are more effective in some classes than others based on network characteristics. Methods: We used a previously validated agent-based model to understand how physical activity spreads in social networks and who was influencing the spread of behavior. From the observed data of 460 participants collected in 26 school classes, we simulated multiple social network interventions with different selection criteria for the influence agents (ie, in-degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and random influence agents) and a control condition (ie, no intervention). Subsequently, we investigated whether the detected variation of an intervention's success within school classes could be explained by structural characteristics of the social networks (ie, network density and network centralization). Results: The 1-year simulations showed that social network interventions were more effective compared with the control condition (beta=.30; t100=3.23; P=.001). In addition, the social network interventions that used a measure of centrality to select influence agents outperformed the random influence agent intervention (beta=.46; t100=3.86; P<.001). Also, the closeness centrality condition outperformed the betweenness centrality condition (beta=.59; t100=2.02; P=.046). The anticipated interaction effects of the network characteristics were not observed. Conclusions: Social network intervention can be considered as a viable and promising intervention method to promote physical activity. We demonstrated the usefulness of applying social network analysis and agent-based modeling as part of the social network interventions' design process. We emphasize the importance of selecting the most successful influence agents and provide a better understanding of the role of network characteristics on the effectiveness of social network interventions.

Association of social network and social support with health-related quality of life and fatigue in long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Hodgkin lymphoma; Quality of life; Social network; Social support; Fatigue and survivorship	BREAST-CANCER SURVIVORS; DISEASE; QUESTIONNAIRE; INVENTORY; LEUKEMIA	As the number of survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) increases, there has been a growing interest in long-term treatment-related side effects and their impact on the quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to assess the association of social network and social support with the QoL and fatigue among long-term HL survivors. A total of 200 HL survivors were included. The generic Short Form-12 (SF-12) questionnaire, the QoL cancer survivor's questionnaire (QOL-CS), and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory were used to assess QoL and fatigue. Social network and social support were evaluated with the Social Support Survey. Social network and all social support measures were favorably associated with two or more SF-12 scales, mainly with physical functioning and the mental health scales. Social network and social support dimensions were also associated with better QOL-CS scores. Affective support, informational support, positive interaction, and emotional support were associated with less fatigue. Both social network and social support are associated with better QoL and lower levels of fatigue in HL survivors. This information may be useful to health professionals and community organizations in implementing effective interventions to improve these patients' quality of life.

Assessing structure and characteristics of social networks among cancer survivors: impact on general health	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Social network size; Social network satisfaction; Social support; General health; Stigma	BREAST-CANCER; LUNG-CANCER; SUPPORT; STIGMA; EXPERIENCES; PROSTATE; QUALITY; WOMEN; SHAME; LIFE	PurposeRobust social networks are associated with improved health and quality of life for cancer survivors. Certain cancer diagnoses are associated with higher levels of stigma than breast cancer. However, little is known about the differences in social networks depending on the type of malignancy. This study aims to assess the differences in social networks and general health between breast cancer and more stigmatized cancers.MethodsCancer survivors were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey study. Social network size and satisfaction was measured using the Cancer Survivor Social Networks Measure. General health was measured with a five-point-Likert-style item.ResultsThe average age of the sample (n=99) was 57.6years old (SD=13.4) and the majority were female (67.7%). Breast cancer survivors had an average of 1.39 more members in their social network than other cancers (t(94)=2.28, p=0.025). There were no significant differences between groups in network satisfaction. Results of a binary logistic regression model explained 26.9% of the variance in general health (x(2)(5)=18.35, p=0.003). There was a significant association among formal support network satisfaction (=-1.23, p=0.021), formal support network size (=-0.36, p=0.019), malignancy type (breast vs. other) (=1.05, p=0.05), and better general health.ConclusionsThe results suggest breast cancer survivors had more formal social supports then other malignancy types. An association among greater formal social network size and satisfaction, a diagnosis of breast instead of other cancers, and better general health was noted. Emphasizing formal support sources for all cancer survivors may improve their overall health.

A pilot survey of individuals and agencies that potentially work with farmers was undertaken and a social network analysis completed to assess the self-reported links of agencies with each other. Thirteen agencies with a role in hearing health service provision participated with results indicating that nurse audiometrists, WorkCover NSW and agricultural retailers have the lead role in disseminating relevant information within the network. For client referrals the nurse audiometrist, private audiometry services, general practitioners, ear, nose and throat specialists and industry groups played the major roles. Social network analysis can assist in defining hearing health networks and can be used to highlight potential actions that can strengthen networks to enhance services for farmers and their families.

Objective To analyse the needs of PPOs in Spain to identify opportunities to improve health services through the use of ICT. Setting and participants A convenience sample of staff from 35 PPOs (54.68% response rate) participated in a structured online survey and three focus groups (12 PPOs). Results Paediatric patient organizations' major needs are to provide accredited and managed information, increase personal support and assistance and promote joint commitment to health care. Moreover, PPOs believe in the Internet's potential to meet their needs and support their activities. Basic limitations to using the Internet are lack of knowledge and resources.

In addition to administrative and billing details of healthcare services, insurance data reveal important information regarding professional interactions and/or links that emerge among healthcare service providers through, for example, informal knowledge sharing. By using details of such professional interactions and social network analysis methods, the aim of the present study was to develop a research framework to explore health care coordination and collaboration. The proposed framework was used to analyse a patient-centric care coordination network and a physician collaboration network. The usefulness of this framework and its applications in exploring collaborative efforts of different healthcare professionals and service providers is discussed.

A social network approach to self-management support implicates the need for facilitation that includes an orientation to connecting to and mobilizing support and resources from other people and the local environment. Objective To identify the facilitation processes through which engagement with a social network approach to self-management is achieved. Method Thematic analysis was used to analyse data from a longitudinal study design using quasi-ethnographic methods comprising non-participant observation, video and qualitative interviews involving 30 participants living with a long-term condition recruited from a marginalized community. Results Findings centred on three themes about the social network approach facilitation processes: reversing the focus on the self by bringing others into view; visualization and reflection as a mediator of positive disruption and linking to new connections; personalized matching of valued activities as a means of realizing preference elicitation. Discussion and conclusions Engagement processes with a social network approach illuminated the relevance of cognizance of an individual's immediate social context and forefronting social participation with others as the bases of self-management support of a long-term condition. This differs from traditional guided facilitation of health behaviour interventions that frame health as a matter of personal choice and individual responsibility.

End-of-life (EOL) communication is a complex process involving the whole family and multiple care providers. Applications of analysis techniques that account for communication beyond the patient and patient/provider will improve clinical understanding of EOL communication. Objectives. The objectives of the study were to introduce the use of social network analysis to EOL communication data and to provide an example of applying social network analysis to home hospice interactions. Methods. We provide a description of social network analysis to model communication patterns during home hospice nursing visits. We describe three social network attributes (i.e., magnitude, directionality, and reciprocity) in the expression of positive emotion among hospice nurses, family caregivers, and hospice cancer patients. Differences in communication structure by primary family caregiver across gender and time were also examined. Results. Magnitude (frequency) in the expression of positive emotion occurred most often between nurses and caregivers or between nurses and patients. Female caregivers directed more positive emotion to nurses, and nurses directed more positive emotion to other family caregivers when the primary family caregiver was male. Reciprocity (mutuality) in positive emotion declined toward day of death but increased on day of actual patient death. There was a variation in reciprocity by the type of positive emotion expressed. Conclusion. Our example demonstrates that social network analysis can be used to better understand the process of EOL communication.

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						physical activity; social marketing; social media	WORD-OF-MOUTH; INVOLVEMENT; PROMOTION; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; FACEBOOK; MEDIA	Background: Electronic word-of-mouth on social network sites has been used successfully in marketing. In social marketing, electronic word-of-mouth about products as health behaviors has the potential to be more effective and reach more young adults than health education through traditional mass media. However, little is known about what motivates people to actively initiate electronic word-of-mouth about health behaviors on their personal pages or profiles on social network sites, thus potentially reaching all their contacts on those sites. Objective: This study filled the gap by applying a marketing theoretical model to explore the factors associated with electronic word-of-mouth on social network sites about leisure-time physical activity. Methods: A Web survey link was sent to undergraduate students at one of the Midwestern universities and 439 of them completed the survey. Results: The average age of the 439 participants was 19 years (SD=1 year, range: 18-24). Results suggested that emotional engagement with leisure-time physical activity (ie, affective involvement in leisure-time physical activity) predicted providing relevant opinions or information on social network sites. Social network site users who perceived stronger ties with all their contacts were more likely to provide and seek leisure-time physical activity opinions and information. People who provided leisure-time physical activity opinions and information were more likely to seek opinions and information, and people who forwarded information about leisure-time physical activity were more likely to chat about it. Conclusions: This study shed light on the application of the electronic word-of-mouth theoretical framework in promoting health behaviors. The findings can also guide the development of future social marketing interventions using social network sites to promote leisure-time physical activity.

Objective: We used wearable sociometric sensor badges to study how intensive care unit (ICU) health care professionals interact and are socially connected. Methods: We studied the face-to-face interaction data of 76 healthcare professionals in the ICU at Mie University Hospital collected over 4 weeks via wearable sensors. Results: We detail the spatiotemporal distributions of staff members' inter- and intraprofessional active face-to-face interactions, thereby generating a comprehensive visualization of who met whom, when, where, and for how long in the ICU. Social network analysis of these active interactions, concomitant with centrality measurements, revealed that nurses constitute the core members of the network, while doctors remain in the periphery. Conclusions: Our social network analysis using the comprehensive ICU interaction data obtained by wearable sensors has revealed the leading roles played by nurses within the professional communication network.

Harnessing social influence is perceived as fundamental for interventions to influence health-related behaviors. However, the mechanisms through which social influence occurs are poorly understood. Online social networks provide the opportunity to understand these mechanisms as they digitally archive communication between members. In this paper, we present a methodology for content-based social network analysis, combining qualitative coding, automated text analysis, and formal network analysis such that network structure is determined by the content of messages exchanged between members. We apply this approach to characterize the communication between members of QuitNet, an online social network for smoking cessation. Results indicate that the method identifies meaningful theme-based social sub-networks. Modeling social network data using this method can provide us with theme-specific insights such as the identities of opinion leaders and sub-community clusters. Implications for design of targeted social interventions are discussed.

With the advance of Web 2.0 technologies, social media present a novel platform for Web users to form online health groups. Members of online health groups discuss health-related issues and mutually help one another by anonymously revealing their mental conditions, sharing personal experiences, exchanging health information, and providing suggestions and support. The conversations in online health groups contain valuable information to facilitate the understanding of their mutual help behaviors and their mental health problems. Objective: We aimed to characterize the conversations in a major online health group for major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in a popular Chinese social media platform. In particular, we intended to explain how Web users discuss depression-related issues from the perspective of the social networks and linguistic patterns revealed by the members' conversations. Methods: Social network analysis and linguistic analysis were employed to characterize the social structure and linguistic patterns, respectively. Furthermore, we integrated both perspectives to exploit the hidden relations between them. Results: We found an intensive use of self-focus words and negative affect words. In general, group members used a higher proportion of negative affect words than positive affect words. The social network of the MDD group for depression possessed small-world and scale-free properties, with a much higher reciprocity ratio and clustering coefficient value as compared to the networks of other social media platforms and classic network models. We observed a number of interesting relationships, either strong correlations or convergent trends, between the topological properties and linguistic properties of the MDD group members. Conclusions: (1) The MDD group members have the characteristics of self-preoccupation and negative thought content, according to Beck's cognitive theory of depression; (2) the social structure of the MDD group is much stickier than those of other social media groups, indicating the tendency of mutual communications and efficient spread of information in the MDD group; and (3) the linguistic patterns of MDD members are associated with their topological positions in the social network.

Based on social network theory, we analyze whether this phenomenon also occurs in offline sources. We also seek to learn more about the type of relationships between information seekers and patients, as research to date indicates that surrogate seeking mostly occurs in close relationships between the seeker and the patient. Methods: Using a large-scale representative survey from the 28 member states of the European Union (N = 26,566), our data comprise all respondents who reported seeking health information online or offline (n = 18,750; 70.6%). Results: Within the past year, 61.0% of the online health information seekers and 61.1% of the offline health information seekers had searched on behalf of someone else. Independent of the information channel, surrogate seekers primarily searched for health information for family members (online: 89.8%; offline: 92.8%); they were significantly less likely to search for information on behalf of someone with whom they had weaker ties, such as colleagues (online: 25.1%; offline: 24.4%). In a multilevel generalized linear model, living together with someone was by far the most relevant determinant for surrogate seeking, with differences between countries or Internet activity being less important. Conclusion: These results support the assumptions of social network theory. Implications are discussed, especially with regard to the provision of adequate health information.

Yet, they currently lack empirical evidence on how consumers use and engage with a PCHMS. An online prospective study was designed to investigate how 709 consumers used a web-based PCHMS to manage their physical and emotional wellbeing over five months. The web-based PCHMS, Healthy. me, was developed at UNSW and incorporates an untethered personal health record, consumer care pathways, forums, polls, diaries, and messaging links with healthcare professionals. The two PCHMS features that consumers used most frequently, found most useful, and engaging were the social features, i.e. forum and poll. Compared to participants who did not use any PCHMS social feature, those who used either the poll or the forum were 12.3% more likely to visit a healthcare professional (P=0.001) during the study. Social network analysis of forums revealed a spectrum of social interaction patterns from question-and-answer structures to community discussions. This study provides a basis for understanding how a PCHMS can be used as a socially-driven intervention to influence consumers' health behaviours.	[Lau, Annie Y.

Application of the Social Network Analysis to Better Comprehend Relationships in Qualitative Health Data	CONNECTING THE SYSTEM TO ENHANCE THE PRACTITIONER AND CONSUMER EXPERIENCE IN HEALTHCARE	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	26th Australian National Health Informatics Conference (HIC)	AUG, 2018	Sydney, AUSTRALIA			Social Network Analysis; implementation study; qualitative data		Objective: To explore social network analysis (SNA) as an additional approach to elucidate quantifiable insight from qualitative health-related textual data. Methods: Key concepts gained from thematic analyses of a set of qualitative health data obtained from an implementation study was analysed using the Excel Add-on module NodeXL Results: Our results show that SNA provided useful visualisation and quantifiable information of the relationship between key concepts obtained from the thematic analysis. Discussion: SNA is a useful technique for exploring and analysing qualitative data, particularly when the research interest is in complex relationships that may exist among a large number of qualitative variables. In addition to providing a way to visualise the relationship between concepts, SNA provides metric measures that can be further analysed quantitatively. Conclusion: The SNA approach allows researchers to explore deeper relationships that may exist among various variables and enable researchers to derive potentially a fuller and more complete appreciation and comprehension of health-related data.

This study is to explore clinical workflow patterns for CRC patients using electronic health records (EHR). In particular, we modeled the clinical workflow (provider-provider interactions) of a CRC patient's workup period as a social network, and identified clusters of workflow patterns based on network characteristics. Understanding of these patterns will help guide healthcare policy-making and practice.

Social networks have a positive association with obesity, smoking cessation and weight loss. This article summarizes studies evaluating the impact of social networks on the management of cardiovascular disease. The 35 studies included in the article describe the impact of social networks on a decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease, depression and mortality. In addition, having a large-sized social network is also associated with better outcomes and improved health. The role of pharmacists is beginning to play an important role in the patient-centered medical home, which needs to be incorporated into social networks. The patient-centered medical home can serve as an adaptive source for social network evolvement.

In the Millennium Villages Project site in Bonsaaso, Ghana, a mobile phone closed user group has been introduced for use by the Bonsaaso Millennium Villages Project Health Team and other key individuals. No assessment on the benefits or barriers of the use of the closed user group had been carried out. Objective: The purpose of this research was to make the case for the use of social network analysis methods to be applied in health systems research-specifically related to mobile health. Methods: This study used mobile phone voice records of, conducted interviews with, and reviewed call journals kept by a mobile phone closed user group consisting of the Bonsaaso Millennium Villages Project Health Team. Social network analysis methodology complemented by a qualitative component was used. Monthly voice data of the closed user group from Airtel Bharti Ghana were analyzed using UCINET and visual depictions of the network were created using NetDraw. Interviews and call journals kept by informants were analyzed using NVivo. Results: The methodology was successful in helping identify effective organizational structure. Members of the Health Management Team were the more central players in the network, rather than the Community Health Nurses (who might have been expected to be central). Conclusions: Social network analysis methodology can be used to determine the most productive structure for an organization or team, identify gaps in communication, identify key actors with greatest influence, and more. In conclusion, this methodology can be a useful analytical tool, especially in the context of mobile health, health services, and operational and managerial research.

However, there is no common language, approach or tool allowing for a valid description, comparison and evaluation of integrated care. Social network analysis could be a viable methodology to provide an objective picture of integrated networks. Goal of the article: To illustrate social network analysis use in the context of systems of care for traumatic brain injury. Method: We surveyed members of a network using a validated questionnaire to determine the links between them. We determined the density, centrality, multiplexity, and quality of the links reported. Results: The network was described as moderately dense (0.6), the most prevalent link was knowledge, and four organisation members of a consortium were central to the network. Social network analysis allowed us to create a graphic representation of the network. Conclusion: Social network analysis is a useful methodology to objectively characterise integrated networks.

J	Valdez, RS; Brennan, PF				Valdez, Rupa Sheth; Brennan, Patricia Flatley			Exploring patients' health information communication practices with social network members as a foundation for consumer health IT design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Health information communication; Social network; Consumer health IT; Engineering design; Qualitative research; Patient engagement	QUALITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; CENTERED DESIGN; SUPPORT; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; INTERNET; CARE; TECHNOLOGY; USABILITY; HOME	Background: There is a need to ensure that the growing number of consumer health information technologies designed to support patient engagement account for the larger social context in which health is managed. Basic research on how patients engage this larger social context is needed as a precursor to the development of patient-centered consumer health information technology (IT) solutions. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to inform the broader design of consumer health IT by characterizing patients' existing health information communication practices with their social network members. Methods: This qualitative study took place between 2010 and 2012 in a Midwestern city. Eighteen patients with chronic conditions participated in a semi-structured interview that was analyzed using qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics. Emphasis was placed on recruiting a sample representing diverse cultural groups and including participants of low socioeconomic status. Results: Participants' social networks included a wide range of individuals, spanning biological relatives, divinities, and second-degree relationships. Participants' rationales for health information communication reflected seven themes: (1) characteristics and circumstances of the person, (2) characteristics and circumstances of the relationship, (3) structure and composition of the social network, (4) content of the message, (5) orientation of the goal, (6) dimensions of the context, and (7) adaptive practices. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that patients' health information communication practices are multidimensional, engaging individuals beyond formal and informal caregivers and driven by characteristics of their personal lives and larger social contexts in addition to their health problem. New models of consumer health IT must be created to better align with the realities of patients' communication routines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Circles of Health: Towards an advanced social network about disabilities of neurological origin	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Knowledge-based systems; Biomedical ontologies; ICF; Medical health records; Decision-support systems	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION	Objectives: This research is concerned with the study of a new social-network platform, which (1) provides people with disabilities of neurological origin, their relatives, health professionals, therapists, carers and institutions with an interoperable platform that supports standard indicators, (2) promotes knowledge democratization and user empowerment, and (3) allows making decisions with a more informed opinion. Methods: A new social network, Circles of Health, has been designed, developed and tested by end-users. To allow monitoring the evolution of people's health status and comparing it with other users and with their cohort, anonymized data of 2675 people from comprehensive and multidimensional medical evaluations, carried out yearly from 2006 to 2010, have been standardized to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, integrated into the corresponding medical health records and then used to automatically generate and graphically represent multidimensional indicators. These indicators have been integrated into Circles of Health's social environment, which has been then evaluated via expert and user-experience analyses. Results: Patients used Circles of Health to exchange bio-psycho-social information (medical and otherwise) about their everyday lives. Health professionals remarked that the use of color-coding in graphical representations is useful to quickly diagnose deficiencies, difficulties or barriers in rehabilitation. Most people with disabilities complained about the excessive amount of information and the difficulty in interpreting graphical representations. Conclusions: Health professionals found Circles of Health useful to generate a more integrative understanding of health based on a comprehensive profile of individuals instead of being focused on patient's diseases and injuries. People with disabilities found enriching personal knowledge with the experiences of other users helpful. The number of descriptors used at the same time in the graphical interface should be reduced in future versions of the social-network platform. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The social systems within which we live our lives (families, schools, workplaces, professions, friendship groups) have a significant influence on our health, success and well-being. These groups can be characterised as networks and analysed using social network analysis. Social Network AnalysisSocial network analysis is a mainly quantitative method for analysing how relationships between individuals form and affect those individuals, but also how individual relationships build up into wider social structures that influence outcomes at a group level. Recent increases in computational power have increased the accessibility of social network analysis methods for application to medical education research. Application to Medical EducationSocial network analysis has been used to explore team-working, social influences on attitudes and behaviours, the influence of social position on individual success, and the relationship between social cohesion and power. This makes social network analysis theories and methods relevant to understanding the social processes underlying academic performance, workplace learning and policy-making and implementation in medical education contexts. ConclusionsSocial network analysis is underused in medical education, yet it is a method that could yield significant insights that would improve experiences and outcomes for medical trainees and educators, and ultimately for patients.

Health officials in Japan have expressed concern about medical "waste" resulting from this practices. We sought to conduct descriptive analysis of duplicative prescriptions using social network analysis and to report their prevalence across ages. Methods: We analyzed a health insurance claims database including 1.24 million people from December 2012. Through social network analysis, we examined the duplicative prescription networks, representing each medical facility as nodes, and individual prescriptions for patients as edges. Results: The prevalence of duplicative prescription for any drug class was strongly correlated with its frequency of prescription (r=0.90). Among patients aged 0-19, cough and colds drugs showed the highest prevalence of duplicative prescriptions (10.8%). Among people aged 65 and over, antihypertensive drugs had the highest frequency of prescriptions, but the prevalence of duplicative prescriptions was low (0.2-0.3%). Social network analysis revealed clusters of facilities connected via duplicative prescriptions, e.g., psychotropic drugs showed clustering due to a few patients receiving drugs from 10 or more facilities. Conclusion: Overall, the prevalence of duplicative prescriptions was quite low-less than 10%-although the extent of the problem varied by drug class and age group. Our approach illustrates the potential utility of using a social network approach to understand these practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We study a health social network that has tracked physical activities, biomarkers, and posts the participants have shared, throughout a one-year program. The program was aimed at helping people to adopt healthy behaviors and to lose weight. In this paper, we focus on users' posts that relate to physical activities. Prior papers characterize health based solely on users' information disclosed through natural language or questionnaires. The drawback of these works is their lack of medical records or health-related information to validate their findings. By contrast, with our direct access to users' physical and medical data, we investigate the implication of users' posts at both individual and group levels. We are able to validate our hypotheses about the effects of certain social network activities, by contextualizing them in the specific users' actual medical progress and documented levels of exercise. Our findings show that activity self-disclosure posts are good indicators of one's real world physical activity, which makes them good resources for monitoring the participants. In addition, using a physical activity propagation model, we show how these posts can influence the physical activity behavior at the network level. Further, posts exhibit distinctive affective, biological, and linguistic style markers. We observe that these characteristics can be used in a predictive capacity, to detect positive activity signals with similar to 88% accuracy, which can be utilized for an unobtrusive monitoring solution.

J	Perez-Manchon, D				Perez-Manchon, David			Telemedicine, a medical social network for humanitarian aid between Spain and Cameroon	GACETA SANITARIA			Spanish	Article						Telemedicine; Africa; International cooperation; Health; Cameroon		The application of information technologies and telecommunications in healthcare in southern countries can improve the health of millions of people living in poverty without access to high-quality health services. Specifically, telemedicine not synchronized with internet platforms is a very efficient option for international cooperation projects. Since its inception, the project Health 2.0: professionals from Africa-Spain connected, of the Spanish organization, Foundation Recover, Hospitals for Africa, has managed to connect health professionals from both continents with the goal of improving health in Cameroon.

Modeling the Spread of an Obesity Intervention through a Social Network	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						weight loss; obesity; diffusion model; health-related behavior; social network	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; WEIGHT; PREVALENCE; OUTCOMES	With the growing prevalence of obesity and the public health implications, it is critical to develop and evaluate potential interventions. One approach is to investigate the spread of positive health outcomes through a social network. We employ the ground concepts of spread maximization problem and adapt it to best reflect the dynamics of a weight loss intervention. A diffusion model is then employed for the propagation of weight loss effect throughout the network of obese and overweight individuals. This diffusion model integrates both personal attributes and network-related attributes of an individual while engaged in a weight loss program. Simulation findings suggest that choosing initial agents based on individual attributes, including ability to lose weight, body mass index, and threshold, produced the highest total weight loss in the network. Greedy algorithm was also applied to choose the most effective subset of initial seeds.

This study describes the social network defined by HCWs' conversations around an influenza vaccination campaign in order to describe the role played by vaccination behavior and other HCW characteristics in the configuration of the links among subjects. Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from 235 HCWs interviewed after the 2010/ 2011 influenza vaccination campaign at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCB), Spain. The study asked: " Who did you talk to or share some activity with respect to the seasonal vaccination campaign?" Variables studied included sociodemographic characteristics and reported conversations among HCWs during the influenza campaign. Exponential random graph models (ERGM) were used to assess the role of shared characteristics (homophily) and individual characteristics in the social network around the influenza vaccination campaign. Results: Links were more likely between HCWs who shared the same professional category (OR 3.13, 95% CI = 2.61-3.75), sex (OR 1.34, 95% CI = 1.09-1.62), age (OR 0.7, 95% CI = 0.63-0.78 per decade of difference), and department (OR 11.35, 95% CI = 8.17-15.64), but not between HCWs who shared the same vaccination behavior (OR 1.02, 95% CI = 0.86-1.22). Older (OR 1.26, 95% CI = 1.14-1.39 per extra decade of HCW) and vaccinated (OR 1.32, 95% CI = 1.09-1.62) HCWs were more likely to be named. Conclusions: This study finds that there is no homophily by vaccination status in whom HCWs speak to or interact with about a workplace vaccination promotion campaign. This result highlights the relevance of social network analysis in the planning of health promotion interventions.

Web 2.0 tools provide a useful mechanism for establishing an online KT environment in which health practitioners share their practice-related knowledge and experiences with an online community of practice. We have implemented a Web 2.0 based KT environment-an online discussion forum-for pediatric pain practitioners across seven different hospitals in Thailand. The online discussion forum enabled the pediatric pain practitioners to share and translate their experiential knowledge to help improve the management of pediatric pain in hospitals. Objective: The goal of this research is to investigate the knowledge sharing dynamics of a community of practice through an online discussion forum. We evaluated the communication patterns of the community members using statistical and social network analysis methods in order to better understand how the online community engages to share experiential knowledge. Methods: Statistical analyses and visualizations provide a broad overview of the communication patterns within the discussion forum. Social network analysis provides the tools to delve deeper into the social network, identifying the most active members of the community, reporting the overall health of the social network, isolating the potential core members of the social network, and exploring the inter-group relationships that exist across institutions and professions. Results: The statistical analyses revealed a network dominated by a single institution and a single profession, and found a varied relationship between reading and posting content to the discussion forum. The social network analysis discovered a healthy network with strong communication patterns, while identifying which users are at the center of the community in terms of facilitating communication. The group-level analysis suggests that there is strong interprofessional and interregional communication, but a dearth of non-nurse participants has been identified as a shortcoming. Conclusions: The results of the analysis suggest that the discussion forum is active and healthy, and that, though few, the interprofessional and interinstitutional ties are strong.

J	Oliver, K; Everett, M; Verma, A; de Vocht, F				Oliver, Kathryn; Everett, Martin; Verma, Arpana; de Vocht, Frank			The human factor: Re-organisations in public health policy	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Social networks; Social network analysis; Public health policy; Reorganisations; Organisational structure	NHS	Introduction: Public health policy-making activities are currently split between local authority and NHS organisations. Despite an increasing body of research on evidence-based policy (EBP), few studies explore the process of policy-making. Little is known about how policies are made in a local context, or how (scientific) evidence is used. Previous research has ignored the 'human element in EBP. Social network analysis (SNA) techniques are becoming increasingly important in health policy. This paper describes an innovative study giving a fresh perspective on policy-making processes in public health. Methods: A social network analysis of public health policy making networks in Greater Manchester based on publicly available data (documents, websites and meeting papers) and an electronic survey, asking actors to nominate those who influenced their own views, those who were powerful, and those who were a source of evidence or information. Results and conclusions: Policy-making networks are described. Formal executive roles are loosely related to perceived influence and power. Evidence-seeking networks are less coherent, with key organisations not represented. These data indicate the importance of collaboration and good relationships between researchers and policy-makers, but few academic researchers with a direct impact on health policy were identified within the networks.

In an online study, participants were asked what information they would want to receive about members of their social network in three categories: someone who was very close, someone who was not so close, and someone who was not close at all. Our results show that the information that people want can be predicted from their gender and emotional proximity to the network member. The closer the relationship with the patient, the more information people want. Women want more information than men. We propose a model for the socially intelligent communication of health information across the social network, and discuss areas for its application.

This is highly relevant for multimorbidity patients care because there is a large number of health professionals in charge of patient care, and this requires to obtain clinical consensus in their decisions. Our objective is to develop a tool for collaborative work among health professionals for multimorbidity patient care. We describe the architecture to incorporate decision support functionalities in a social network tool to enable the adoption of shared decisions among health professionals from different care levels. As part of the first stage of the project, this paper describes the results obtained in a pilot study about acceptance and use of the social network component in our healthcare setting. Methods: At Virgen del Rocio University Hospital we have designed and developed the Shared Care Platform (SCP) to provide support in the continuity of care for multimorbidity patients. The SCP has two consecutively developed components: social network component, called Clinical Wall, and Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. The Clinical Wall contains a record where health professionals are able to debate and define shared decisions. We conducted a pilot study to assess the use and acceptance of the SCP by healthcare professionals through questionnaire based on the theory of the Technology Acceptance Model. Results: In March 2012 we released and deployed the SCP, but only with the social network component. The pilot project lasted 6 months in the hospital and 2 primary care centers. From March to September 2012 we created 16 records in the Clinical Wall, all with a high priority. A total of 10 professionals took part in the exchange of messages: 3 internists and 7 general practitioners generated 33 messages. 12 of the 16 record (75%) were answered by the destination health professionals. The professionals valued positively all the items in the questionnaire. As part of the SCP, opensource tools for CDS will be incorporated to provide recommendations for medication and problem interactions, as well as to calculate indexes or scales from validated questionnaires. They will receive the patient summary information provided by the regional Electronic Health Record system through a web service with the information defined according to the virtual Medical Record specification. Conclusions: Clinical Wall has been developed to allow communication and coordination between the healthcare professionals involved in multimorbidity patient care. Agreed decisions were about coordination for appointment changing, patient conditions, diagnosis tests, and prescription changes and renewal. The application of interoperability standards and open source software can bridge the gap between knowledge and clinical practice, while enabling interoperability and scalability. Open source with the social network encourages adoption and facilitates collaboration. Although the results obtained for use indicators are still not as high as it was expected, based on the promising results obtained in the acceptance questionnaire of SMP, we expect that the new CDS tools will increase the use by the health professionals.

In particular, in the case of Department of Psychiatry from the Zamora Hospital (Spain), the period of time which patients require institutionalized care is a tiny part of their treatment. A large part of health care provided to the patient is aimed at his/her rehabilitation and social integration through day-care centres, supervised flats or activities. Conversely, several reports reveal that approximately 50 % of Internet users use the network as a source of health information, which has led to the emergence of virtual communities where patients, relatives or health professionals share their knowledge concerning an illness, health problem or specific health condition. In this context, we have identified that the relatives have a lack of information regarding the daily activities of patients under psychiatric treatment. The social networks or the virtual communities regarding health problems do not provide a private space where relatives can follow the patient's progress, despite being in different places. The goal of the study was to use technologies to develop a private social network for being used by severe mental patients (mainly schizophrenic patients). SocialNet is a pioneer social network in the health sector because it provides a social interaction context restricted to persons authorized by the patient or his/her legal guardian in such a way that they can track his/her daily activity. Each patient has a private area only accessible to authorized persons and their caregivers, where they can share pictures, videos or texts regarding his/her progress. A preliminary study of usability of the system has been made for increasing the usefulness and usability of SocialNet. SocialNet is the first system for promoting personal interactions among formal caregivers, family, close friends and patient, promoting the recovery of schizophrenic patients. Future studies should study the network's potential usefulness for improving the prognosis and recovery of schizophrenia.

Use of Social Network Sites for Communication Among Health Professionals: Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Review						social networking; social media; health communication; Facebook; WhatsApp; professional network; health professionals	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; FACEBOOK; ONLINE; WHATSAPP; SURGEONS; TWITTER; DEFINITION; ATTITUDES; MESSENGER; EXCHANGE	Background: Although much research has been done investigating the roles of social network sites (SNSs) in linking patients and health professionals, there is a lack of information about their uses, benefits, and limitations in connecting health professions only for professional communication. Objective: This review aimed to examine the utilization of SNSs for communication among health professionals in (1) frontline clinical practice, (2) professional networks, and (3) education and training to identify areas for future health communication research. Methods: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. A systematic search of the literature published in the last 10 years (January 1, 2007, to March 1, 2017) was performed in March 2017, using the following electronic databases: MEDLINE via OvidSP, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, and InfoSci-Journals. The searches were conducted using the following defined search terms: "social media" OR "social network" OR "social network site" OR " Facebook" OR "Twitter" OR "Linkedin" OR "Instagram" OR "Weibo" OR "Whatsapp" OR "Telegram" OR "WeChat" AND " health" OR "health profession." Results: Of the 6977 papers retrieved, a total of 33 studies were included in this review. They were exploratory in nature, and the majority used surveys (n=25) and interviews (n=6). All retrieved studies stated that SNSs enhanced effective communication and information sharing. SNSs were used for supporting delivering of clinical services, making referrals, and sharing information. They were beneficial to network building and professional collaboration. SNSs were novel tools to enhance educational interactions among peers, students, instructors, and preceptors. The application of SNSs came with restraints in technical knowledge, concerns on data protection, privacy and liability, issues in professionalism, and data protection. Conclusions: SNSs provide platforms facilitating efficient communication, interactions, and connections among health professionals in frontline clinical practice, professional networks, education, and training with limitations identified as technical knowledge, professionalism, and risks of data protection. The evolving use of SNSs necessitates robust research to explore the full potential and the relative effectiveness of SNSs in professional communication.	[Chan, Windy S.

The staff of two headspace centres were surveyed to identify with whom they collaborated during routine work, and when faced with uncertain situations. Social network analysis was used to assess interprofessional collaboration within each center and across varying situations. Interprofessional collaboration was identified in both routine and uncertain situations. Staff of headspace (clinical and non-clinical) maintained a tendency to collaborate with colleagues outside of their professional group, compared to within. Networks were well connected when staff collaborated in routine work and when faced with uncertainty related to decision-making. However, there were fewer interactions during times of role uncertainty. The headspace centre that had been in operation for longer showed greater indicators of cohesiveness. Future research should consider context and self-organization when considering the efficacy of networks.

It can help understanding the underlying structural and behavioral complexities that influence the process of capacity building towards evidence-informed decision making. A social network analysis was conducted to understand if and how the staff of a public health department in Ontario turn to peers to get help incorporating research evidence into practice. Methods: The staff were invited to respond to an online questionnaire inquiring about information seeking behavior, identification of colleague expertise, and friendship status. Three networks were developed based on the 170 participants. Overall shape, key indices, the most central people and brokers, and their characteristics were identified. Results: The network analysis showed a low density and localized information-seeking network. Inter-personal connections were mainly clustered by organizational divisions; and people tended to limit information-seeking connections to a handful of peers in their division. However, recognition of expertise and friendship networks showed more cross-divisional connections. Members of the office of the Medical Officer of Health were located at the heart of the department, bridging across divisions. A small group of professional consultants and middle managers were the most-central staff in the network, also connecting their divisions to the center of the information-seeking network. In each division, there were some locally central staff, mainly practitioners, who connected their neighboring peers; but they were not necessarily connected to other experts or managers. Conclusions: The methods of social network analysis were useful in providing a systems approach to understand how knowledge might flow in an organization. The findings of this study can be used to identify early adopters of knowledge translation interventions, forming Communities of Practice, and potential internal knowledge brokers.

We focus on the latter, by exploiting the relationship between individuals' social interactions and their mental health to predict one's likelihood of being depressed or anxious from rich dynamic social network data. Existing studies differ from our work in at least one aspect: they do not model social interaction data as a network; they do so but analyze static network data; they examine "correlation" between social networks and health but without making any predictions; or they study other individual traits but not mental health. In a comprehensive evaluation, we show that our predictive model that uses dynamic social network data is superior to its static network as well as non-network equivalents when run on the same data.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA is the current legislation for privacy protection. However, the Institute of Medicine Committee on Health Research and the Privacy of Health Information recently concluded that HIPAA cannot adequately safeguard the privacy, while at the same time researchers cannot use the medical data for effective researches. Therefore, more effective privacy protection methods are urgently needed to ensure the security of released medical data. Methods: Privacy protection methods based on clustering are the methods and algorithms to ensure that the published data remains useful and protected. In this paper, we first analyzed the importance of the key attributes of medical data in the social network. According to the attribute function and the main objective of privacy protection, the attribute information was divided into three categories. We then proposed an algorithm based on greedy clustering to group the data points according to the attributes and the connective information of the nodes in the published social network. Finally, we analyzed the loss of information during the procedure of clustering, and evaluated the proposed approach with respect to classification accuracy and information loss rates on a medical dataset. Results: The associated social network of a medical dataset was analyzed for privacy preservation. We evaluated the values of generalization loss and structure loss for different values of k and a, i.e. k = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30}, a = {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1}. The experimental results in our proposed approach showed that the generalization loss approached optimal when a = 1 and k = 21, and structure loss approached optimal when a = 0.4 and k = 3. Conclusion: We showed the importance of the attributes and the structure of the released health data in privacy preservation. Our method achieved better results of privacy preservation in social network by optimizing generalization loss and structure loss. The proposed method to evaluate loss obtained a balance between the data availability and the risk of privacy leakage.

If there are positive and sustained effects, then social network technologies could increase the effectiveness and efficiency of many public health campaigns. Social media alone, however, may be insufficient to promote health. Furthermore, there may be unintended and potentially harmful consequences of inaccurate or misleading health information. Given these uncertainties, there is a need to understand and synthesize the evidence base for the use of online social networking as part of health promoting interventions to inform future research and practice. Objective: Our aim was to review the research on the integration of expert-led health promotion interventions with online social networking in order to determine the extent to which the complementary benefits of each are understood and used. We asked, in particular, (1) How is effectiveness being measured and what are the specific problems in effecting health behavior change?, and (2) To what extent is the designated role of social networking grounded in theory? Methods: The narrative synthesis approach to literature review was used to analyze the existing evidence. We searched the indexed scientific literature using keywords associated with health promotion and social networking. The papers included were only those making substantial study of both social networking and health promotion-either reporting the results of the intervention or detailing evidence-based plans. General papers about social networking and health were not included. Results: The search identified 162 potentially relevant documents after review of titles and abstracts. Of these, 42 satisfied the inclusion criteria after full-text review. Six studies described randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of online social networking within health promotion interventions. Most of the trials investigated the value of a "social networking condition" in general and did not identify specific features that might play a role in effectiveness. Issues about the usability and level of uptake of interventions were more common among pilot studies, while observational studies showed positive evidence about the role of social support. A total of 20 papers showed the use of theory in the design of interventions, but authors evaluated effectiveness in only 10 papers. Conclusions: More research is needed in this area to understand the actual effect of social network technologies on health promotion. More RCTs of greater length need to be conducted taking into account contextual factors such as patient characteristics and types of a social network technology. Also, more evidence is needed regarding the actual usability of online social networking and how different interface design elements may help or hinder behavior change and engagement. Moreover, it is crucial to investigate further the effect of theory on the effectiveness of this type of technology for health promotion. Research is needed linking theoretical grounding with observation and analysis of health promotion in online networks.

J	Kuan, YT; Wang, TF; Guo, CY; Tang, FI; Hou, IC				Kuan, Ya-Ting; Wang, Tze-Fang; Guo, Chao-Yu; Tang, Fu-In; Hou, I-Ching			Wound Care Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices and Mobile Health Technology Use in the Home Environment: Cross-Sectional Survey of Social Network Users	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						mobile health; wound; knowledge; attitudes; practices; home environment	MHEALTH	Background: Injury causing wounds is a frequent event. Inadequate or inappropriate treatment of injuries can threaten individual health. However, little is known about wound care knowledge, attitudes, and practices and mobile health (mHealth) use in the home environment in Taiwan. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate wound care knowledge, attitudes, and practices and mHealth technology use among social network users. Methods: A cross-sectional survey on social media platforms was conducted on adults aged 20 years and older. Data were collected from social network users in the home environment. Results: A total of 361 participants were enrolled. The mHealth technology use of participants was positively correlated with wound care knowledge (r=.132, P=.01), attitudes (r=.239, P<.001), and practices (r=.132, P=.01). Participants did not have adequate knowledge (correct rate 69.1%) and were unfamiliar with the guidelines of proper wound care (correct rate 74.5%). Most participants had positive attitudes toward wound care and mHealth technology use. A total of 95.6% (345/361) of participants perceived that the use of mHealth technology can improve wound care outcomes, and 93.9% (339/361) perceived that wound care products should be optimized to be used with a mobile device. However, 93.6% (338/361) of participants had no experience using mHealth technology for wound care. Conclusions: Our study shows the potential of mHealth technology to enhance wound care knowledge among social network users. Thus, government agencies and medical institutions in Taiwan should provide easy-to-use information products that enhance wound care knowledge, promote adequate behavior toward wound care, and prevent unpredictable or undesirable outcomes.

Social network platforms, where users can express their emotions, feelings, and thoughts, are a valuable source of data for researching mental health, and techniques based on machine learning are increasingly used for this purpose. Objective: The objective of this review was to explore the scope and limits of cutting-edge techniques that researchers are using for predictive analytics in mental health and to review associated issues, such as ethical concerns, in this area of research. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review in March 2017, using keywords to search articles on data mining of social network data in the context of common mental health disorders, published between 2010 and March 8, 2017 in medical and computer science journals. Results: The initial search returned a total of 5386 articles. Following a careful analysis of the titles, abstracts, and main texts, we selected 48 articles for review. We coded the articles according to key characteristics, techniques used for data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, model construction, and model verification. The most common analytical method was text analysis, with several studies using different flavors of image analysis and social interaction graph analysis. Conclusions: Despite an increasing number of studies investigating mental health issues using social network data, some common problems persist. Assembling large, high-quality datasets of social media users with mental disorder is problematic, not only due to biases associated with the collection methods, but also with regard to managing consent and selecting appropriate analytics techniques.

The purpose of this study was the identification of the key actors and the user communities in such a network. We used the publicly available data from a diabetes forum to create the corresponding network and explore several algorithms for the detection of user communities. The degree centrality of the network followed the power law distribution demonstrating that only a few users were the key actors in the forum. It was also shown that it is feasible to infer the top communities from a forum using certain algorithms; the key actors participated in these communities. Our approach could be applied to other health forums and be extended to examine additional aspects.

The current applications in the healthcare sphere can support the health management, but to date there is no patient-controlled integrator. This paper proposes a platform called Multiple Profile Manager (MPM) that enables a user to create and manage an integrated profile that can be shared across numerous social network sites. Moreover, it is able to facilitate the collection of personal healthcare data, which makes a contribution to the development of public health informatics. Here we want to illustrate how patients and physicians can be benefited from enabling the platform for online social network sites. The MPM simplifies the management of patients' profiles and allows health professionals to obtain a more complete picture of the patients' background so that they can provide better health care.

Objective: Our objective was to assess whether the use of social networks is associated with increased anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic among members of critical care teams. Methods: We distributed a web-based survey to physicians, residents, registered and auxiliary nurses, and nurse anesthetists providing critical care (anesthesiology, intensive care, or emergency medicine) in several French hospitals. The survey evaluated the respondents' use of social networks, their sources of information on COVID-19, and their levels of anxiety and information regarding COVID-19 on analog scales from 0 to 10. Results: We included 641 respondents in the final analysis; 553 (86.3%) used social networks, spending a median time of 60 minutes (IQR 30-90) per day on these networks. COVID-19-related anxiety was higher in social network users than in health care workers who did not use these networks (median 6, IQR 5-8 vs median 5, IQR 3-7) in univariate (P=.02) and multivariate (P<.001) analyses, with an average anxiety increase of 10% in social network users. Anxiety was higher among health care workers using social networks to obtain information on COVID-19 than among those using other sources (median 6, IQR 5-8 vs median 6, IQR 4-7; P=.04). Social network users considered that they were less informed about COVID-19 than those who did not use social networks (median 8, IQR 7-9 vs median 7, IQR 6-8; P<.01). Conclusions: Our results suggest that social networks contribute to increased anxiety in critical care teams. To protect their mental health, critical care professionals should consider limiting their use of these networks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A multiple case study	GACETA SANITARIA			English	Article						Intimate partner violence; Primary health care team; Women-centred care; Case study; Social network analysis	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; READINESS; SETTINGS; SERVICES; PROGRAM	Objective: To analyse how team level conditions influenced health care professionals' responses to intimate partner violence. Methods: We used a multiple embedded case study. The cases were four primary health care teams located in a southern region of Spain; two of them considered "good" and two s "average". The two teams considered good had scored highest in practice issues for intimate partner violence, measured via a questionnaire (PREMIS - Physicians Readiness to Respond to Intimate Partner Violence Survey) applied to professionals working in the four primary health care teams. In each case quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a social network questionnaire, interviews and observations. Results: The two "good" cases showed dynamics and structures that promoted team working and team learning on intimate partner violence, had committed social workers and an enabling environment for their work, and had put into practice explicit strategies to implement a women-centred approach. Conclusions: Better individual responses to intimate partner violence were implemented in the teams which: 1) had social workers who were knowledgeable and motivated to engage with others; 2) sustained a structure of regular meetings during which issues of violence were discussed; 3) encouraged a friendly team climate; and 4) implemented concrete actions towards women-centred care.

The study design was modelled on a social network analysis socio-centric model. Data collection was conducted primarily by Aboriginal community members who were trained as community researchers. Participants reported on their patterns of interaction and who they provided or received health information from, and awareness of the Aboriginal Enhancement of the Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service. In total, 122 participants across two sites participated in the study. Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs) and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs) were cited as the main provider of health information in both sites. Between-ness, degree and closeness centrality showed that certain community members, ACCHS and ACCHO within the two communities in the present study were considerable enablers [actors] in enhancing the reach and flow of health information to their respective Aboriginal community. There is potential for future health-promotion activities to be increasingly targeted and effective in terms of reach and influence, if guided by local Aboriginal organisations and by key Aboriginal community members within and across family networks and communities.

Social network analysis of medication advice-seeking interactions among staff in an Australian hospital	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Communication; Interprofessional relations; Health personnel; Hospitals; Social support; Medication systems	HEALTH-CARE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; NURSES; DESIGN; IMPACT	Purpose: To examine the medication advice-seeking network of staff in a hospital ward. Methods: Social network analysis was carried out in a renal ward of an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital. The medication advice-seeking interactions of doctors, nurses, allied health professionals (including a pharmacist) and a ward clerk were examined using data from questionnaires administered to staff. The questionnaire listed all staff who worked in the ward and sought information from respondents regarding their interactions with each staff member. Data were analysed using social network software, UCINET. Analyses performed included geodesic distance, network density, strength of ties, reciprocation of relations, and centrality of individuals. NetDraw was used to produce social network diagrams. Results: A very high response rate of 96% was achieved with 45 of 47 staff returning the questionnaire. On average, there is little interaction between each of the staff members in the medication advice-seeking network, with even less interaction between staff from different professional groups. Nurses are mainly located on one side of the network and doctors on the other. However, the pharmacist is quite central in the medication advice-seeking network as are some senior nurses and a junior doctor. Conclusions: When hospital clinical staff seek medication advice from other members of a ward it tends to be sought from those in their profession. However key individuals in the ward are relied upon for the provision of medication advice by staff from all professions. Social network analysis can be used to examine the complex medication advice-seeking interactions amongst staff in a hospital ward, providing useful quantitative baseline data against which to compare the effect of interventions, such as an electronic medication system, on interactions.

But little is known about their structure, mechanism and effectiveness. The aim of this paper is to analyze health system integration and develop recommendations for achieving integration. Method: Huangzhong and Hualong counties in Qinghai province were studied as study sites, with only Huangzhong having implemented health system integration. Questionnaires, interviews, and health insurance records were sources of data. Social network analysis was employed to analyze integration, through structure measurement and effectiveness evaluation. Results: Health system integration in Huangzhong is higher than in Hualong, so is system effectiveness. The patient referral network in Hualong has more "leapfrog" referrals. The information sharing networks in both counties are larger than the other types of networks. The average distance in the joint training network of Huangzhong is less than in Hualong. Meanwhile, there are deficiencies common to both systems. Conclusion: Both county health systems have strengths and limitations regarding system integration. The use of medical consortia in Huangzhong has contributed to system effectiveness. Future research might consider alternative more context specific models of health system integration.

The dissemination of educational innovations through scholarship was a priority. The objective of this study was to explore the patterns of collaboration of educational innovation through the consortium's publications. Method Publications were identified from grantee schools' semi-annual reports. Each publication was coded for the number of citations, Altmetric score, domain of scholarship, and collaboration with other institutions. Social network analysis explored relationships at the midpoint and end of the grant. Results Over five years, the 32 Consortium institutions produced 168 publications, ranging from 38 papers from one institution to no manuscripts from another. The two most common domains focused on health system science (92 papers) and competency-based medical education (30 papers). Articles were published in 54 different journals. Forty percent of publications involved more than one institution. Social network analysis demonstrated rich publishing relationships within the Consortium members as well as beyond the Consortium schools. In addition, there was growth of the network connections and density over time. Conclusion The Consortium fostered a scholarship network disseminating a broad range of educational innovations through publications of individual school projects and collaborations.

J	Song, I; Marsh, NV				Song, Insu; Marsh, Nigel V.			Anonymous Indexing of Health Conditions for a Similarity Measure	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Health informatics; health social network recommender system; similarity measure		A health social network is an online information service which facilitates information sharing between closely related members of a community with the same or a similar health condition. Over the years, many automated recommender systems have been developed for social networking in order to help users find their communities of interest. For health social networking, the ideal source of information for measuring similarities of patients is the medical information of the patients. However, it is not desirable that such sensitive and private information be shared over the Internet. This is also true for many other security sensitive domains. A new information-sharing scheme is developed where each patient is represented as a small number of (possibly disjoint) d-words (discriminant words) and the d-words are used to measure similarities between patients without revealing sensitive personal information. The d-words are simple words like "food," and thus do not contain identifiable personal information. This makes our method an effective one-way hashing of patient assessments for a similarity measure. The d-words can be easily shared on the Internet to find peers who might have similar health conditions.

In total 980 people participated in the feasibility study organized in three studies: (1) within a group of university students (88 participants), (2) in a small town (422 participants), and (3) within a university community (470 participants). We gathered self-reported data through the Wakamola chatbot regarding participants diet, physical activity, social network, living area, obesity-associated diseases, and sociodemographic data. For each study, we calculated the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) and number of people in each BMI level. Also, we defined and calculated scores (1-100 scale) regarding global health, BMI, alimentation, physical activity and social network. Moreover, we graphically represented obesity risk for living areas and the social network with nodes colored by BMI. Students group results: Mean BMI 21.37 (SD 2.57) (normal weight), 8 people underweight, 5 overweight, 0 obesity, global health status 78.21, alimentation 63.64, physical activity 65.08 and social 26.54, 3 areas with mean BMI level of obesity, 17 with overweight level. Small town ' s study results: Mean BMI 25.66 (SD 4.29) (overweight), 2 people underweight, 63 overweight, 26 obesity, global health status 69.42, alimentation 64.60, physical activity 60.61 and social 1.14, 1 area with mean BMI in normal weight; University ' s study results: Mean BMI 23.63 (SD 3.7) (normal weight), 22 people underweight, 86 overweight, 28 obesity, global health status 81.03, alimentation 81.84, physical activity 70.01 and social 1.47, 3 areas in obesity level, 19 in overweight level. Wakamola is a health care chatbot useful to collect relevant data from populations in the risk of overweight and obesity. Besides, the chatbot provides individual self-assessment of BMI and general status regarding the style of living. Moreover, Wakamola connects users in a social network to help the study of O & O ' s causes from an individual, social and socio-economic perspective.

Oral health related quality of life in pregnant and post partum women in two social network domains; predominantly home-based and work-based networks	HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES			English	Article						women's health; oral health; quality of life; social support; social networks; occupation	DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; WHITEHALL II; SUPPORT; RISK; MORTALITY; STRESS; MEN; POPULATION; DISEASE; ROLES	Background: Individuals connected to supportive social networks have better general and oral health quality of life. The objective of this study was to assess whether there were differences in oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) between women connected to either predominantly home-based and work-based social networks. Methods: A follow-up prevalence study was conducted on 1403 pregnant and post-partum women (mean age of 25.2 +/- 6.3 years) living in two cities in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Women were participants in an established cohort followed from pregnancy (baseline) to post-partum period (follow-up). All participants were allocated to two groups; 1. work-based social network group - employed women with paid work, and, 2. home-based social network group women with no paid work, housewives or unemployed women. Measures of social support and social network were used as well as questions on sociodemographic characteristics and OHRQoL and health related behaviors. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to obtain OR of relationships between occupational contexts, affectionate support and positive social interaction on the one hand, and oral health quality of life, using the Oral Health Impacts Profile (OHIP) measure, adjusted for age, ethnicity, family income, schooling, marital status and social class. Results: There was a modifying effect of positive social interaction on the odds of occupational context on OHRQoL. The odds of having a poorer OHIP score, >= 4, was significantly higher for women with home-based social networks and moderate levels of positive social interactions [OR 1.64 (95% CI: 1.08-2.48)], and for women with home-based social networks and low levels of positive social interactions [OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.40-3.30)] compared with women with work-based social networks and high levels of positive social interactions. Black ethnicity was associated with OHIP scores >= 4 [OR 1.73 (95% CI: 1.23-2.42)]. Conclusions: Pregnant and post-partum Brazilian women in paid employment outside the home and having social supports had better OHRQoL than those with home-based social networks.

J	Hartford, W; Backman, C; Li, LDC; McKinnon, A; Nimmon, L				Hartford, Wendy; Backman, Catherine; Li, Linda C.; McKinnon, Annette; Nimmon, Laura			Appropriating and asserting power on inflammatory arthritis teams: A social network perspective	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						agency; control; identity; illness stories; inflammatory arthritis; power; treatment decisions	TREATING RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; PATIENT-CENTERED CARE; DECISION-MAKING; SELF; PEOPLE; TARGET; WOMEN; HARD	Background Therapeutic interventions for people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) increasingly involve multidisciplinary teams and strive to foster patient-centred care and shared decision making. Participation in health-care decisions requires patients to assert themselves and negotiate power in encounters with clinicians; however, clinical contexts often afford less authority for patients than clinicians. This disadvantage may inhibit patients' involvement in their own health care. Objective To identify communication attributes, IA patients use to influence and negotiate their treatment with members of their health-care network. Method A qualitative social network approach was used to analyse data from a larger study that investigated IA patients' overall experiences of multidisciplinary care. Fourteen patients with IA attended individual semi-structured interviews. Researchers used thematic analysis to identify patterns of assertiveness and influence in the data. Results Participants experienced loss of identity, control and agency in addition to the physical symptoms of IA. However, they had a sense of personal responsibility for managing their health care. Perceptions of health-care team support enhanced patients' influence in treatment negotiations. Notably, there appeared to be an underlying tension between being empowered or disempowered. Discussion and conclusions The findings have significant implications for treatment decision communication approaches to IA care. A social network perspective may provide a pathway for clinicians to better understand the complexities of communication with their patients. This approach may reduce unequal power dynamics that occur within clinician/patient interactions and afford people with IA agency, control and affirmation of identity within their health-care network.

Research so far has addressed the computerized execution of clinical protocols by developing a number of related representation languages, execution engines and integrated platforms to support real time execution. However, much less effort has been put into organizing clinical protocols for use and reuse. In this paper we propose a heterogeneous semantic social network to describe and organize clinical protocols based on their provenance, evolution and modifications. The proposed approach allows semantic tagging and enrichment of clinical protocols so that they can be used and re-used across platforms and also be linked directly to other relevant scientific information, e.g. published works in PubMed or personal health records, and other clinical information systems.

A distinctive feature adopted in the system to maintain the retention rate of patients was the social network service (SNS) that enables the patients to share their dietary and relevant health information with other participants in the same group on the network. A pilot study was conducted to prove the effectiveness of the system in improving the patient's lifestyle and dietary health awareness. SNS also contributed to the participant's adherence to intervention programs.

Improving access to health information for older migrants by using grounded theory and social network analysis to understand their information behaviour and digital technology use	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE			English	Article						e-health; older people; CALD; migrants; social network analysis; grounded theory	INTERNET; GREEK; COMMUNICATION; COMMUNITY; SERVICES; ADULTS	Migrant well-being can be strongly influenced by the migration experience and subsequent degree of mainstream language acquisition. There is little research on how older Culturally And Linguistically Diverse (CALD) migrants who have 'aged in place' find health information, and the role which digital technology plays in this. Although the research for this paper was not focused on cancer, we draw out implications for providing cancer-related information to this group. We interviewed 54 participants (14 men and 40 women) aged 63-94 years, who were born in Italy or Greece, and who migrated to Australia mostly as young adults after World War II. Constructivist grounded theory and social network analysis were used for data analysis. Participants identified doctors, adult children, local television, spouse, local newspaper and radio as the most important information sources. They did not generally use computers, the Internet or mobile phones to access information. Literacy in their birth language, and the degree of proficiency in understanding and using English, influenced the range of information sources accessed and the means used. The ways in which older CALD migrants seek and access information has important implications for how professionals and policymakers deliver relevant information to them about cancer prevention, screening, support and treatment, particularly as information and resources are moved online as part of e-health.

For example, friendly chat on Facebook, professional discussion on LinkedIn, and health information exchange on PatientsLikeMe. Thus many web users need to manage many disparate profiles across many distributed online sources. Maintaining these profiles is cumbersome, time consuming, inefficient, and leads to lost opportunity. In this paper we propose a framework for multiple profile management of online social networks and showcase a demonstrator utilising an open source platform. The result of the research enables a user to create and manage an integrated profile and share/synchronise their profiles with their social networks. A number of use cases were created to capture the functional requirements and describe the interactions between users and the online services. An innovative application of this project is in public health informatics. We utilize the prototype to examine how the framework can benefit patients and physicians. The framework can greatly enhance health information management for patients and more importantly offer a more comprehensive personal health overview of patients to physicians.

J	Edwards, M; Wood, F; Davies, M; Edwards, A				Edwards, Michelle; Wood, Fiona; Davies, Myfanwy; Edwards, Adrian			'Distributed health literacy': longitudinal qualitative analysis of the roles of health literacy mediators and social networks of people living with a long-term health condition	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						decsion making; health communication; health literacy; long-term conditions; patient education	DECISION-MAKING; CARE; PARTICIPATION; KNOWLEDGE; SUPPORT	Background The role of one's social network in the process of becoming health literate is not well understood. We aim to explain the 'distributed' nature of health literacy and how people living with a long-term condition draw on their social network for support with health literacy-related tasks such as managing their condition, interacting with health professionals and making decisions about their health. Design This paper reports a longitudinal qualitative interview and observation study of the development and practice of health literacy in people with long-term health conditions, living in South Wales, UK. Participants were recruited from health education groups (n = 14) and community education venues (n = 4). The 44 interview transcripts were analysed using the 'Framework' approach. Results Health literacy was distributed through family and social networks, and participants often drew on the health literacy skills of others to seek, understand and use health information. Those who passed on their health literacy skills acted as health literacy mediators and supported participants in becoming more health literate about their condition. The distribution of health literacy supported participants to manage their health, become more active in health-care decision-making processes, communicate with health professionals and come to terms with living with a long-term condition. Participants accessed health literacy mediators through personal and community networks. Conclusion Distributed health literacy is a potential resource for managing one's health, communicating with health professionals and making health decisions.

J	Blanchet, K; James, P				Blanchet, Karl; James, Philip			The role of social networks in the governance of health systems: the case of eye care systems in Ghana	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Social networks; health systems; ophthalmology; health services; management	ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; PROGRAM SUSTAINABILITY; ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT; DECISION SPACE; SECTOR REFORM; RESILIENCE; DECENTRALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; CENTRALITY	Efforts have been increasingly invested to improve local health systems' capacities in developing countries. We describe the application of innovative methods based on a social network analysis approach. The findings presented refer to a study carried out between July 2008 and January 2010 in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. Social network analysis methods were applied in five different districts using the software package Ucinet to calculate the various properties of the social network of eye care providers. The study focused on the managerial decisions made by Ghanaian district hospital managers about the governance of the health system. The study showed that the health system in the Brong Ahafo region experienced significant changes specifically after a key shock, the departure of an international organization. Several other actors at different levels of the network disappeared, the positions of nurses and hospital managers changed, creating new relationships and power balances that resulted in a change in the general structure of the network. The system shifted from a centralized and dense hierarchical network towards an enclaved network composed of five sub-networks. The new structure was less able to respond to shocks, circulate information and knowledge across scales and implement multi-scale solutions than that which it replaced. Although the network became less resilient, it responded better to the management needs of the hospital managers who now had better access to information, even if this information was partial. The change of the network over time also showed the influence of the international organization on generating links and creating connections between actors from different levels. The findings of the study reveal the importance of creating international health connections between actors working in different spatial scales of the health system.

A Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Review						systematic review; social network; behavior change; intervention; Internet; physical activity; weight loss	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY INTERVENTION; MASS-MEDIA CAMPAIGNS; WEIGHT-LOSS; FACEBOOK; BURDEN	Background: The dramatic growth of Web 2.0 technologies and online social networks offers immense potential for the delivery of health behavior change campaigns. However, it is currently unclear how online social networks may best be harnessed to achieve health behavior change. Objective: The intent of the study was to systematically review the current level of evidence regarding the effectiveness of online social network health behavior interventions. Methods: Eight databases (Scopus, CINAHL, Medline, ProQuest, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science and Communication & Mass Media Complete) were searched from 2000 to present using a comprehensive search strategy. Study eligibility criteria were based on the PICOS format, where "population" included child or adult populations, including healthy and disease populations; "intervention" involved behavior change interventions targeting key modifiable health behaviors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behavior) delivered either wholly or in part using online social networks; "comparator" was either a control group or within subject in the case of pre-post study designs; "outcomes" included health behavior change and closely related variables (such as theorized mediators of health behavior change, eg, self-efficacy); and "study design" included experimental studies reported in full-length peer-reviewed sources. Reports of intervention effectiveness were summarized and effect sizes (Cohen's d and 95% confidence intervals) were calculated wherever possible. Attrition (percentage of people who completed the study), engagement (actual usage), and fidelity (actual usage/intended usage) with the social networking component of the interventions were scrutinized. Results: A total of 2040 studies were identified from the database searches following removal of duplicates, of which 10 met inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 113,988 participants (ranging from n=10 to n=107,907). Interventions included commercial online health social network websites (n=2), research health social network websites (n=3), and multi-component interventions delivered in part via pre-existing popular online social network websites (Facebook n=4 and Twitter n=1). Nine of the 10 included studies reported significant improvements in some aspect of health behavior change or outcomes related to behavior change. Effect sizes for behavior change ranged widely from -0.05 (95% CI 0.45-0.35) to 0.84 (95% CI 0.49-1.19), but in general were small in magnitude and statistically non-significant. Participant attrition ranged from 0-84%. Engagement and fidelity were relatively low, with most studies achieving 5-15% fidelity (with one exception, which achieved 105% fidelity). Conclusions: To date there is very modest evidence that interventions incorporating online social networks may be effective; however, this field of research is in its infancy. Further research is needed to determine how to maximize retention and engagement, whether behavior change can be sustained in the longer term, and to determine how to exploit online social networks to achieve mass dissemination. Specific recommendations for future research are provided.

Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases. Study Design Data Collection/Extraction Methods Social network analysis identified "care communities" (providers sharing a high number of patients) and measured BH integration in terms of how connected, or central, BH providers were to other providers in their community. Multivariable generalized linear models adjusting for age, sex, number of prescriptions, and Charlson comorbidity score were used to estimate the relationship between the centrality of BH providers and health care utilization of BH patients. Used outpatient, inpatient, and pharmacy claims data from six Medicaid plans from 2011 to 2013 to identify study outcomes, comorbidities, providers, and health care encounters. Principal Findings Conclusions Behavioral health centrality ranged from 0 (no BH providers) to 0.49. Relative to communities at the median BH centrality (0.06), in 2012, BH patients in communities at the 75th percentile of BH centrality (0.31) had 0.2 fewer admissions, 2.1 fewer all-cause ED visits, and accrued $1,947 fewer costs, on average. Increased behavioral centrality was significantly associated with a reduced number of ED visits, less frequent inpatient admissions, and lower overall health care costs.

Social Network Members' Roles and Use of Mental Health Services Among Drug Users in New York City	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES & RESEARCH			English	Article							DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; HIV PREVENTION; HIGH-RISK; INTERVENTION; CARE; ACCESS; SAMPLE; ENTRY; MULTILEVEL; ADDICTION	Depression is more common among drug users (15-63 %) than the general population (5-16 %). Lack of social support network members may be associated with low mental health service (MHS) use rates observed among drug users. We investigated the relationship between social network members' roles and MHS use among frequent drug users using Social Ties Associated with Risk of Transition into Injection Drug Use data (NYC 2006-2009). Surveys assessed depression, MHS use, demographics, drug use and treatment, and social network members' roles. Participants reporting lifetime depressive episode with start/end dates and information on social/risk network members were included (n = 152). Adjusting for emotional support and HIV status, having one or more informational support network members remained associated with MHS use at last depressive episode (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.38-8.19), as did history of drug treatment (AOR 2.75, 95 % CI 1.02-7.41) and no legal income (AOR 0.23, 95 % CI 0.08-0.64). These data suggest that informational support is associated with MHS utilization among depressed drug users.

The objective of this paper is to propose a semi-automatic moderation Web Service for assessing the quality (trustworthiness) of health-related videos published on the YouTube social network. The service is relevant for moderators or community managers, who get enabled to control the quality of videos published on their online HSN sites. The HealthTrust metric was selected as the metric to be implemented in the service in order to support the assessment of trustworthiness of videos in Online HSN. The service is a RESTful service which can be integrated into open source Virtual Social Network Platforms, therefore improving trust in the process of searching and publishing content extracted from YouTube. A preliminary pilot evaluation in a simple use case demonstrated that the relevance of videos retrieved using the moderation service was higher compared to the relevance of the videos retrieved using the YouTube search engine.

J	Mukinda, FK; Van Belle, S; Schneider, H				Mukinda, Fidele Kanyimbu; Van Belle, Sara; Schneider, Helen			Local Dynamics of Collaboration for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health: A Social Network Analysis of Healthcare Providers and Their Managers in Gert Sibande District, South Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Collaboration; Accountability; District Health System; Social Network Analysis; Quality Improvement		Background: Accountability for maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) is a collaborative endeavour and documenting collaboration dynamics may be key to understanding variations in the performance of MNCH services. This study explored the dynamics of collaboration among frontline health professionals participating in two MNCH coordination structures in a rural South African district. It examined the role and position of actors, the nature of their relationships, and the overall structure of the collaborative network in two sub-districts. Methods: Cross-sectional survey using a social network analysis (SNA) methodology of 42 district and sub district actors involved in MNCH coordination structures. Different domains of collaboration (eg, communication, professional support, innovation) were surveyed at key interfaces (district-sub-district, across service delivery levels, and within teams). Results: The overall network structure reflected a predominantly hierarchical mode of clustering of organisational relationships around hospitals and their referring primary healthcare (PHC) facilities. Clusters were linked through (and dependent on) a combination of district MNCH programme and line managers, identified as central connectors or boundary spanners. Overall network density remained low suggesting potential for strengthening collaborative relationships. Within cluster collaborative patterns (inter-professional and across levels) varied, highlighting the significance of small units in district functioning. Conclusion: SNA provides a mechanism to uncover the nature of relationships and key actors in collaborative dynamics which could point to system strengths and weaknesses. It offers insights on the level of fragmentation within and across small units, and the need to strengthen cohesion and improve collaborative relationships, and ultimately, the delivery of health services.

J	Sun, QD; Wang, N; Li, SC; Zhou, HY				Sun, Qindong; Wang, Nan; Li, Shancang; Zhou, Hongyi			Local spatial obesity analysis and estimation using online social network sensors	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Online social networks; Internet of things (IoT); Obesity; Health informatics; Bioinformatics; Public health	PERSONALIZED HEALTH-CARE; TWITTER; INTERNET; SYSTEMS; THINGS; FLU	Recently, the online social networks (OSNs) have received considerable attentions as a revolutionary platform to offer users massive social interaction among users that enables users to be more involved in their own healthcare. The OSNs have also promoted increasing interests in the generation of analytical, data models in health informatics. This paper aims at developing an obesity identification, analysis, and estimation model, in which each individual user is regarded as an online social network 'sensor' that can provide valuable health information. The OSN-based obesity analytic model requires each sensor node in an OSN to provide associated features, including dietary habit, physical activity, integral/incidental emotions, and self-consciousness. Based on the detailed measurements on the correlation of obesity and proposed features, the OSN obesity analytic model is able to estimate the obesity rate in certain urban areas and the experimental results demonstrate a high success estimation rate. The measurements and estimation experimental findings created by the proposed obesity analytic model show that the online social networks could be used in analyzing the local spatial obesity problems effectively.

Rapid sociometric mapping of community health workers to identify opinion leaders using an SMS platform: a short report	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							NETWORK; DIFFUSION	Background: Using opinion leaders to accelerate the dissemination of evidence-based public health practices is a promising strategy for closing the gap between evidence and practice. Network interventions (using social network data to accelerate behavior change or improve organizational performance) are a promising but under-explored strategy. We aimed to use mobile phone technology to rapidly and inexpensively map a social network and identify opinion leaders among community health workers in a large HIV program in western Kenya. Methods: We administered a five-item socio-metric survey to community health workers using a mobile phone short message service (SMS)-based questionnaire. We used the survey results to construct and characterize a social network of opinion leaders among respondents. We calculated the extent to which a particular respondent was a popular point of reference ("degree centrality") and the influence of a respondent within the network ("eigenvector centrality"). Results: Surveys were returned by 38/39 (97%) of peer health workers contacted; 52% were female. The median survey response time was 13.75 min (inter-quartile range, 8.8-38.7). The total cost of relaying survey questions through a secure cloud-based SMS aggregator was $8.46. The most connected individuals (high degree centrality) were also the most influential (high eigenvector centrality). The distribution of influence (eigenvector centrality) was highly skewed in favor of a single influential individual at each site. Conclusions: Leveraging increasing access to SMS technology, we mapped the network of influence among community health workers associated with a HIV treatment program in Kenya. Survey uptake was high, response rates were rapid, and the survey identified clear opinion leaders. In sum, we offer proof of concept that a " mobile health" (mHealth) approach can be used in resource-limited settings to efficiently map opinion leadership among health care workers and thus open the door to reproducible, feasible, and efficient empirically based network interventions that seek to spread novel practices and behaviors among health care workers.

However, there is a large gap between the postulated and empirically demonstrated benefits of e-health technologies and a need for a clearer mapping of its conceptual domains. Therefore, this study aimed to critically review the main research topics and trends of international e-health through social network analysis. Materials and Methods: Medical subject heading terms were used to retrieve 3,023 research articles published from 1979 through 2014 in the PubMed database. We extracted n-grams from the corpus using a text analysis program, generated co-occurrence networks, and then analyzed and visualized the networks using Pajek software. The hub and authority measures identified the most important research topics in e-health. Newly emerging topics by 4-year period units were identified as research trends. Results: The most important research topics in e-health are personal health records (PHR), health information technology, primary care, mobile health, clinical decision support systems (CDSS), and so on. The eight groups obtained through ego network analysis can be divided into four semantically different areas, as follows: information technology, infrastructure, services, and subjects. Also, four historical trends in e-health research are identified: the first focusing on e-health and telemedicine; the second, PHR and monitoring; the third, CDSS and alert; and the fourth, mobile health and health literacy. Conclusions: This study promotes a systematic understanding of e-health by identifying topic networks, thereby contributing to the future direction of e-health research and education.

In this paper, we take up the challenge and present a pioneering new method of analysis in drawing on theoretical and methodological extensions of two prominent approaches, namely, social network analysis and developmental social ecology. Considered in combination, these two seemingly disparate approaches frame a powerful new way of thinking about person-centred care, as well as offer a methodologically more rigorous set of analytical tools. The conceptual model developed from this combination offers to bridge the apparent disconnect between service integration levels and patient needs in such a way as to direct optimal effort to interventions at the individual level and to provide a new innovative approach to the delivery of integrated care.

By integrating service sectors at a system level, the diversity of needs of youth with concurrent disorders can be addressed in a more holistic way. The objective of the present study was to quantify the level of cross-sectoral integration in youth-focused services in Canada. Methods: Social network analysis (SNA) was used to examine the relationships between eight sectors: addictions, child welfare, education, physical health, housing, mental health, youth justice, and other social services. A total of 597 participants representing twelve networks of youth-serving agencies across Canada provided information on their cross-sectoral contacts and referrals. Results: Overall, results suggested a moderate level of integration between sectors. The mental health and the addictions sectors demonstrated only moderate integration, while the addictions sector was strongly connected with the youth justice sector. Conclusions: Despite evidence of moderate integration, increased integration is called for to better meet the needs of youth with concurrent mental health and substance use concerns across youth-serving sectors. Ongoing efforts to enhance the integration between youth-serving sectors should be a primary focus in organizing networks serving youth with concurrent mental health and substance use needs.

Theme coding was applied to identify information needs while social network analysis was used to compare Chinese and American HCQA. In theory, we combine Social Network Analysis and content analysis to capture and contrast the pattern of Q&A in HCQA. On the one hand, the core needs of HCQA are "how to treat the disease" and the "diet" theme is closely related to other themes. On the other hand, the Chinese diabetes communities have "question and answer attributes" while the American diabetes communities have both "question and answer attributes" and "social support attributes." In practice, the founding provides enlightenment for the development of HCQA including improving content quality and strengthen emotional connection and disease treatment infrastructure.

Sexual health influencers are individuals who are particularly capable of spreading information about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) within their social networks. However, it remains unknown whether a sexual health influencer can encourage their peers to self-test for HIV/syphilis. Objective: The aims of this study were to examine the impact of MSM sexual health influencers on improving HIV/syphilis self-test uptake within their social networks compared to that of nonsexual health influencers. Methods: In Zhuhai, China, men 16 years or older, born biologically male, who reported ever having had sex with a man, and applying for HIV/syphilis self-tests were enrolled online as indexes and encouraged to distribute self-tests to individuals (alters) in their social network. Indexes scoring >3 on a sexual health influencer scale were considered to be sexual health influencers (Cronbach alpha=.87). The primary outcome was the mean number of alters encouraged to test per index for sexual health influencers compared with the number encouraged by noninfluencers. Results: Participants included 371 indexes and 278 alters. Among indexes, 77 (20.8%) were sexual health influencers and 294 (79.2%) were noninfluencers. On average, each sexual health influencer successfully encouraged 1.66 alters to self-test compared to 0.51 alters encouraged by each noninfluencer (adjusted rate ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.59-2.69). More sexual health influencers disclosed their sexual orientation (80.5% vs 67.3%, P=.02) and were community-based organization volunteers (18.2% vs 2.7%, P<.001) than noninfluencers. More alters of sexual health influencers came from a rural area (45.5% vs 23.8%, P<.001), had below-college education (57.7% vs 37.1%, P<.001), and had multiple casual male sexual partners in the past 6 months (25.2% vs 11.9%, P<.001). Conclusions: Being a sexual health influencer was associated with encouraging more alters with less testing access to self-test for HIV/syphilis. Sexual health influencers can be engaged as seeds to expand HIV/syphilis testing coverage.

T2DM is a multisystemic disease, requiring multidisciplinary treatment provided by teams working in a coordinated and collaborative manner. The application of social network analysis techniques in the healthcare domain has allowed researchers to analyze interaction between professionals and their roles inside care teams. We studied whether the structure of care teams, modeled as complex social networks, is associated with patient progression. For this, we illustrate a data-driven methodology and use existing social network analysis metrics and metrics proposed for this research. We analyzed appointment and HbA1c blood test result data from patients treated at three primary health care centers, representing six different practices. Patients with good metabolic control during the analyzed period were treated by teams that were more interactive, collaborative and multidisciplinary, whereas patients with worsening or unstable metabolic control were treated by teams with less collaboration and more continuity breakdowns. Results from the proposed metrics were consistent with the previous literature and reveal relevant aspects of collaboration and multidisciplinarity.

It selects group posts regarding the COVID-19 vaccination dispute on the Douban platform, analyzes the positions of different users, and explores phenomena related to users obtaining health information on domestic social platforms according to different topics and information behaviors. The results reveal a linear relationship between the negative and neutral attitudes of netizens on social networking platforms. Moreover, netizens tend to hold subjective language when expressing their views and attitudes, and their views on social platforms will not change easily.

In this context, Health Social Networks are acquiring greater force in people's lives by offering them opportunities for social networking to expose questions, experiences, besides new treatments and seek to form relationships giving or receiving emotional support. We developed a Healthcare Social Network called "Minha Saude", a virtual environment that facilitates contact between patients with cardiovascular problems with the goal to promote actions related to social inclusion of people involved. Through a called "Care Plan" available in the Social Network, we tried to motivate patients to get more interest in their own care. Daily activities, emotional states, symptoms and situations will be provided by the patient in the system through any device with internet connection. This information will be used to visualize the progress of patient's health and can be used to make medical decisions as needed. Also, we distinguish an important fact related to the Care Plan, which is the inter-relationship between patients with similar characteristics, we found it important to this action that patients can feed back their experiences and this fact can serve as motivation for them to adhere more their treatments. For this, we developed an algorithm following a Content-plus-link approach for friendship recommendation between those patients who share similar interests and thus increase the level of collaboration and communication between them. This recommendation is based on data from clinical profile, health status, interests and possible previously existing connections. The results are promising about to use of the Care Plan module and the recommendations that were accepted by the participants to create friendship.

A User-Centered Chatbot (Wakamola) to Collect Linked Data in Population Networks to Support Studies of Overweight and Obesity Causes: Design and Pilot Study	JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						mHealth; obesity; overweight; chatbot; assessment; public health; Telegram; user-centered design; Social Network Analysis		Background: Obesity and overweight are a serious health problem worldwide with multiple and connected causes. Simultaneously, chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a way to interact with users in mobile health apps. Objective: This study reports the user-centered design and feasibility study of a chatbot to collect linked data to support the study of individual and social overweight and obesity causes in populations. Methods: We first studied the users' needs and gathered users' graphical preferences through an open survey on 52 wireframes designed by 150 design students; it also included questions about sociodemographics, diet and activity habits, the need for overweight and obesity apps, and desired functionality. We also interviewed an expert panel. We then designed and developed a chatbot. Finally, we conducted a pilot study to test feasibility. Results: We collected 452 answers to the survey and interviewed 4 specialists. Based on this research, we developed a Telegram chatbot named Wakamola structured in six sections: personal, diet, physical activity, social network, user's status score, and project information. We defined a user's status score as a normalized sum (0-100) of scores about diet (frequency of eating 50 foods), physical activity, BMI, and social network. We performed a pilot to evaluate the chatbot implementation among 85 healthy volunteers. Of 74 participants who completed all sections, we found 8 underweight people (11%), 5 overweight people (7%), and no obesity cases. The mean BMI was 21.4 kg/m(2) (normal weight). The most consumed foods were olive oil, milk and derivatives, cereals, vegetables, and fruits. People walked 10 minutes on 5.8 days per week, slept 7.02 hours per day, and were sitting 30.57 hours per week. Moreover, we were able to create a social network with 74 users, 178 relations, and 12 communities. Conclusions: The Telegram chatbot Wakamola is a feasible tool to collect data from a population about sociodemographics, diet patterns, physical activity, BMI, and specific diseases. Besides, the chatbot allows the connection of users in a social network to study overweight and obesity causes from both individual and social perspectives.

Methods: In order to determine the utilization and acceptability of the closed user group amongst users, social network analysis and qualitative methods were used. Key informants were identified and interviewed. The key informants also kept prospective call journals. Billing statements and de-identified call data from the closed user group were used to generate data for analyzing the social structure revealed by the network traffic. Results: The majority of communication within the closed user group was personal and not for professional purposes. The members of the CUG felt that the group improved their efficiency at work. Conclusions: The methods used present an interesting way to investigate the social structure surrounding communication via mobile phones. In addition, the benefits identified from the exploration of this closed user group make a case for supporting mobile phone closed user groups amongst professional groups.

Keywords from January 1967 to June 2016 were extracted from PubMed using Medical Subject Headings terms. Social network analysis was performed using Gephi software. Research publications and newly emerging topics in nursing-related communication in intensive care units were classified into five chronological phases. After the weighting was adjusted, the top five keyword searches were conflict, length of stay, nursing continuing education, family, and nurses. During the most recent phase, research topics included critical care nursing, patient handoff, and quality improvement. The keywords of the top three groups among the 10 groups identified were related to neonatal nursing and practice guideline, infant or pediatric and terminal care, and family, aged, and nurse-patient relations, respectively. This study can promote a systematic understanding of communication in intensive care units by identifying topic networks. Future studies are needed to conduct large prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials to verify the effects of patient-centered communication in intensive care units on patient outcomes, such as length of hospital stay and mortality.

We explored applications of adopting an SNA lens to inform implementation planning, engagement and execution, and evaluation. We used Health Links, a province-wide program in Canada aiming to improve care coordination among multiple providers of high-needs patients, as an example of a health system intervention. At the planning phase, an SNA can depict the structure, network influencers, and composition of clusters at various levels. It can inform the engagement and execution by identifying potential targets (e.g., opinion leaders) and by revealing structural gaps and clusters. It can also be used to assess the outcomes of the intervention, such as its success in increasing network connectivity; changing the position of certain actors; and bridging across specialties, organizations, and sectors. We provided an overview of how an SNA lens can shed light on the complexity of implementation along the entire implementation pathway, by revealing the relational barriers and facilitators, the application of network-informed and network-altering interventions, and testing hypotheses on network consequences of the implementation.

Traces from interaction via social media provide the opportunity for understanding how a community is formed and maintained online. Objective: The paper aims to demonstrate how social network analysis provides a vocabulary and set of techniques for examining interaction patterns via social media. Using the case of the #hcsmca online discussion forum, this paper highlights what has been and can be gained by approaching online community from a social network perspective, as well as providing an inside look at the structure of the #hcsmca community. Methods: Social network analysis was used to examine structures in a 1-month sample of Twitter messages with the hashtag #hcsmca (3871 tweets, 486 unique posters), which is the tag associated with the social media-supported group Health Care Social Media Canada. Network connections were considered present if the individual was mentioned, replied to, or had a post retweeted. Results: Network analyses revealed patterns of interaction that characterized the community as comprising one component, with a set of core participants prominent in the network due to their connections with others. Analysis showed the social media health content providers were the most influential group based on in-degree centrality. However, there was no preferential attachment among people in the same professional group, indicating that the formation of connections among community members was not constrained by professional status. Conclusions: Network analysis and visualizations provide techniques and a vocabulary for understanding online interaction, as well as insights that can help in understanding what, and who, comprises and sustains a network, and whether community emerges from a network of online interactions.

Despite this, no sufficient attention has been paid to physical rehabilitation services and no specific financial resources have been allocated to such services in many countries including Iran. Owing to the fact that effective decision- and policy-making requires identifying possible stakeholders and actors and their characteristics, in the current study a stakeholder analysis and also a social network analysis (SNA) was conducted to identify the potential stakeholders and also their characteristics involved in physical rehabilitation financing (PRF)-related policies in Iran.MethodsThe present study was performed in two phases. Firstly, semi-structured interviews and relevant document review were conducted to identify the stakeholders. Then, the position, power, interest, and influence of each stakeholder were determined using a web-based questionnaire. Secondly, SNA approach was utilized to map and visualize the interactions among stakeholders.ResultsThe findings showed that there are different stakeholders in PRF-related decision- and policy-making processes in Iran. In addition, the position, power, interest, and influence level of the identified stakeholders were varied. Moreover, although some stakeholders, like the Ministry of Health and the parliament have the highest level of power and position, they lack sufficient interest to participate in PRF-policies. Furthermore, SNA demonstrated that social network density was low, which indicates the lack of proper collaboration and interaction among the stakeholders.ConclusionAs many powerful and influential stakeholders had low interest levels to warrant participate in the FPR-related decision- and policy-making processes in Iran, employing careful and effective strategies, that is ongoing negotiations, receiving advocacy, and making senior managers and policy-makers aware can be helpful.

This suggests the need for a new intervention. Materials and Methods: In this study, we designed a smartphone application, With U, to aid weight loss by using an offline social network of friends and an online social network, Facebook. To determine the effects of With U, this study was designed as a one-group pretest-posttest design. Overweight, obese, and severely obese adults 20-40 years old, along with their friends, participated in this study. A total of 10 pairs attempted to lose weight for 4 weeks. We used a questionnaire to measure general characteristics, motivation, and intent to continue to use With U, and the Inbody 720 (Biospace, Seoul, Republic of Korea) body composition analyzer was used to measure physical characteristics. In addition, we briefly interviewed the participants about their experience. Results: We observed statistically significant effects in terms of motivation to lose weight and the amount of weight loss. Changes in physical characteristics beyond weight loss also showed positive trends. Also, we discovered some interesting facts during the interviews. The weight loss effect was greater when the team members met more and the relationship between the challengers was more direct and intimate. Conclusions: The application With U, designed and developed to allow friends to challenge each other to lose weight, affected both motivation to lose weight and the amount of weight loss. In the future, effects of smartphone applications for health management with social networks need to be studied further.

We sought to explore the benefits of 'care maps' - a patient-identified social network map of their care community - for health professionals in providing person-centred care. Methods We piloted care maps with 39 patients with long-term conditions in three urban and one rural general practice and two hospital wards. We interviewed the health professionals (n = 39) of these patients about what value, if any, care maps added to patient care. We analysed health professional interview data using thematic analysis to identify common themes. Results Health professionals all said they learned about their patients as a person-in-context. There was an increased understanding of patients' support networks, synthesising what is known and unknown. Health professionals understood patients' perceptions of health professionals and what really mattered to patients. There was discussion about the therapeutic value of care maps. The maps prompted reflection on practice. Discussion Care maps facilitated a broader focus than the clinical presentation. Using care maps may enable health professionals to support self-management rather than feeling responsible for many aspects of care. Care maps had 'social function' for health professionals. They may be a valuable tool for patients and clinicians to bridge the gap between medical treatment and patients' lifeworlds.

The objective of this study was to assess the inter-organization infrastructure that supports the provision of selected health services in the reconstruction phase after conflict in northern Uganda. Applied social network analysis was used to establish the structure, size and function among organizations supporting the provision of (1) HIV treatment, (2) maternal delivery services and (3) workforce strengthening. Overall, 87 organizations were identified from 48 respondent organizations in the three post-conflict districts in northern Uganda. A two-stage snowball approach was used starting with service provider organizations in each district. Data included a list of organizations and their key attributes related to the provision of each service for the year 2012-13. The findings show that inter-organization networks are mostly focused on HIV treatment and least for workforce strengthening. The networks for HIV treatment and maternal services were about 3-4 times denser relative to the network for workforce strengthening. The network for HIV treatment accounted for 69-81% of the aggregated network in Gulu and Kitgum districts. In contrast, the network for workforce strengthening contributed the least (6% and 10%) in these two districts. Likewise, the networks supporting a young district (Amuru) was under invested with few organizations and sparse connections. Overall, organizations exhibited a broad range of functional roles in supporting HIV treatment compared to other services in the study. Basic information about the inter-organization setup (infrastructure)-can contribute to knowledge for building organization networks in more equitable ways.

J	Zhong, B; Liu, Q				Zhong, Bu; Liu, Qian			Medical Insights from Posts About Irritable Bowel Syndrome by Adolescent Patients and Their Parents: Topic Modeling and Social Network Analysis	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						irritable bowel syndrome; health care forum; adolescent; parents; topic modeling; social network analysis	FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS; CHILDREN; ONLINE; PAIN	Background: Adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are increasingly seeking and sharing information about their symptoms in web-based health care forums. Their posts and those from their parents contain critical insights that can be used by patients, physicians, and caregivers to manage IBS symptoms. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the posts from adolescent patients and their parents in a health forum, IBS Group, to better understand the key challenges, concerns, and issues of interest to young patients with IBS and their caregivers. Methods: Using topic modeling and social network analysis, in this study, we analyzed all the messages (over 750 topics and 3400 replies) posted on the IBS Group forum from 2010-2019 by adolescents with IBS aged 13-17 years and parents having children with IBS. We first detected 6 major topics in the posts by adolescent patients and parents on teenagers' IBS symptoms and the interaction between the topics. Social network analysis was then performed to gain insights into the nature of web-based interaction patterns among patients and caregivers. Results: Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and a latent Dirichlet allocation visualization tool, this study revealed 6 leading topics of concern in adolescents with IBS: school life, treatment or diet, symptoms, boys' ties to doctors, social or friend issues, and girls' ties to doctors. The top 6 topics in the parents' discussions were school life, girls' issues, boys' issues, diet choice, symptoms, and stress. The analyses show that the adolescent patients themselves are most concerned about the effect of IBS on their everyday activities and social lives. For parents having daughters with IBS, their top concerns were related to the girls' school performance and how much help they received at school. For their sons, the parents were more concerned about the pain and suffering that their sons had to endure. Both parents and adolescents gained social support from the web-based platform. Topic modeling shows that IBS affects teenagers the most in the areas of pain and school life. Furthermore, the issues raised by parents suggest that girls are bothered more by school performance over pain, whereas boys show exactly the opposite: pain is of greater concern than school performance. Conclusions: This study represents the first attempt to leverage both machine learning approaches and social network analysis to identify top IBS concerns from the perspectives of adolescent patients and caregivers in the same health forum. Young patients with IBS must face the challenges of social influences and anxiety associated with this health disorder in addition to physical pain and other symptoms. Boys and girls are affected differently by pain and school performance and view the IBS impacts differently from the parents.

Social Network Analysis of a Simulation Community	SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE			English	Article						Social network analysis; communities of practice; online survey; collaboration	COMMUNICATION; STRATEGY	Introduction Graphical analysis of networking maps can be used to measure the health, connectivity, and vulnerabilities of a professional community. We aimed to capture and map the connections and relationships between individuals and organizations in the healthcare simulation community of the state of Western Australia. It was also intended that this analysis would encourage new opportunities for collaboration to advance simulation-based education. Methods In association with a baseline list of established simulation practitioners, an online survey instrument and propriety mapping software were used to establish links and interactions between individuals, colleagues, their own, and external organizations. Results There were 79 respondents to the survey, with 500 pairs of relationships generated for 203 nominated personnel. Two thirds of respondents were from medical, nursing, and allied health fields. The average number of collaborators for each respondent was 6.6. Collaborative patterns were presented in matrices and social network maps. These data identified leaders, important networks, and weaknesses in this community of practice. Conclusions The study confirmed that there were a handful of simulation educators with many linkages both within and external to their own organizations. In addition, isolated groups with poor cross-organizational associations were identified. This information can be used by healthcare and educational organizations, and funding agencies, to better understand associations and collaborations across the wider simulation community and to consider appropriate improvements to strengthen the simulation network.

Factors influencing women's willingness to volunteer in the healthcare system: evidence from the Islamic Republic of Iran	EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article							PARTICIPATION	This casecontrol study evaluated the factors influencing volunteering in the Islamic Republic of Irans Womens Health Volunteer (WHV) programme, which is implemented in 150 centres in Khorasan-e-Razavi Province. We recruited 145 cases (volunteers) and 146 controls (non-volunteers) from the centres. Data were collected by questionnaire. Sociodemographic variables included were: length of residence in neighbourhood, number of siblings, husbands age and education and job, family size, quality of life, self-rated health status, neighbourhood intimacy, child under 2 years, house ownership, wealth index. Social network variables included were: ego network size, type of acquaintance, intimacy with others, relationship communication, relationship duration, emotional support, advisory support, monetary support, physical support, time support. There were significant associations (P < 0.05) between women's propensity to volunteer and family size, presence of a child under 2 years in the family, neighbourhood intimacy, social network composition, and emotional and advisory support.

J	Mascia, D; Di Vincenzo, F; Cicchetti, A				Mascia, Daniele; Di Vincenzo, Fausto; Cicchetti, Americo			Dynamic analysis of interhospital collaboration and competition: Empirical evidence from an Italian regional health system	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Competition; Collaboration; Hospitals; Social network analysis; Organizational theory; Italy	MANAGED COMPETITION; ALLIANCE FORMATION; NETWORK; CARE; HOSPITALS; COORDINATION; PERFORMANCE; EVOLUTION; KNOWLEDGE; PATTERNS	Background: Policymakers stimulate competition in universalistic health-care systems while encouraging the formation of service provision networks among hospital organizations. This article addresses a gap in the extant literature by empirically analyzing simultaneous collaboration and competition between hospitals within the Italian National Health Service, where important procompetition reforms have been implemented. Purpose: To explore how rising competition between hospitals relates to their propensity to collaborate with other local providers. Methods: Longitudinal data on interhospital collaboration and competition collected in an Italian region from 2003 to 2007 are analyzed. Social network analysis techniques are applied to study the structure and dynamics of interhospital collaboration. Negative binomial regressions are employed to explore how interhospital competition relates to the collaborative network over time. Results: Competition among providers does not hinder interhospital collaboration. Collaboration is primarily local, with resource complementarity and differentials in the volume of activity and hospital performance explaining the propensity to collaborate. Conclusions: Formation of collaborative networks among hospitals is not hampered by reforms aimed at fostering market forces. Because procompetition reforms elicit peculiar forms of managed competition in universalistic health systems, studies are needed to clarify whether the positive association between interhospital competition and collaboration can be generalized to other health-care settings.

Primary care networks and team effectiveness: the case of a large-scale quality improvement disparity reduction program	JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE			English	Article						Quality Improvement; Disparities; Social Network Analysis; Perceived Team Effectiveness	HEALTH-CARE; SOCIAL NETWORK; CENTRALITY; SUCCESS; SAFETY	Documentation of primary care teams' involvement in disparity reduction efforts exists, yet little is known about how teams interact or perceive their effectiveness. We investigated how the social network and structural ties among primary-care-clinic team members relate to their perceived team effectiveness (TE), in a large-scale disparity reduction intervention in Israel's largest insurer and provider of services. A mixed-method design of Social Network Analysis and qualitative data collection was employed. 108 interviews with medical, nursing, and administrative teams of 26 clinics and their respective managerial units were performed and information on the organizational ties, analyzing density and centrality, collected. Pearson correlations examined association between network measures and perceived TE. Clinics with strong intra-clinic density and high clinic-subregional-management density were positively correlated with perceived TE. Clinic in-degree centrality was also positively associated with perceived TE. Qualitative analyses support these findings with teamwork emerging as a factor which can impede or facilitate teams' ability to design and implement disparity reduction interventions. The study demonstrates that in an organization-wide disparity reduction initiative, cohesive intra-network structure and close relations with mid-level management increase the likelihood that teams perceive themselves as possessing the skills and resources needed to lead and implement disparity reduction efforts.

Most research to date has focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and development of orphan drugs, while few studies have examined the topics and emotions expressed by patients living with rare diseases on social media platforms, especially in online health communities (OHCs). Objective: This study aimed to determine the topic categorizations and sentiment polarity for albinism in a Chinese OHC, Baidu Tieba, using multiple methods. The OHC was deeply mined using topic mining, social network analysis, and sentiment polarity analysis. Through these methods, we determined the current situation of community construction, identifying the ongoing needs and problems experienced by people with albinism in their daily lives. Methods: We used the albinism community on the Baidu Tieba platform as the data source in this study. Term frequency-inverse document frequency, latent dirichlet allocation models, and naive Bayes were employed to mine the various topic categories. Social network analysis, which was completed using the Gephi tool, was employed to analyze the evolution of the albinism community Sentiment polarity analysis was performed using a long short-term memory algorithm. Results: We identified 8 main topics discussed in the community . daily sharing, family, interpersonal communication, social life and security, medical care, occupation and education, beauty, and self-care. Among these topics, daily sharing represented the largest proportion of the discussions. From 2012 to 2019, the average degree and clustering coefficient of the albinism community continued to decline, while the network center transferred from core communities to core users. A total of 68.43% of the corpus was emotional, with 35.88% being positive and 32.55% negative. There were statistically significant differences in the distribution of sentiment polarity between topics (P<.001). Negative emotions were twice as high as positive emotions in the social life and security topic. Conclusions: The study reveals insights into the emotions expressed by people with albinism in the Chinese OHC, Baidu Tieba, providing health care practitioners with greater appreciation of the current emotional support needed by patients and the patient experience. Current OHCs do not exert enough influence due to limited effective organization and development. Health care sectors should take greater advantage of OHCs to support vulnerable patients with rare diseases to meet their evidence-based needs.

This study aims to evaluate the usability of SocialNet, a private social network for monitoring the daily progress of patients by their relatives, using a mixed usability approach: heuristic evaluation conducted by experts and user testing. A double heuristic evaluation with one expert evaluator identified the issues related to consistency, design, and privacy. User testing was conducted on 20 users and one evaluator using observation techniques and questionnaires. The main usability problems were found to be related to the structure of SocialNet, and the users presented some difficulties in locating the buttons or links. The results show a high level of usability and satisfaction with the product. This evaluation provides data on the usability of SocialNet based on the difficulties experienced by the users and the expert. The results help in redesigning the tool to resolve the identified problems as part of an iterative process.

In this study, we developed a machine learning model to predict a patient's response to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey's "Doctor Communications" domain questions while simultaneously identifying most impactful providers in a network. Materials and Methods: This is an observational study of patients admitted to a single tertiary care hospital between 2016 and 2020. Using machine learning algorithms, electronic health record data were used to predict patient responses to Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey questions in the doctor domain, and patients who are at risk for responding negatively were identified. Model performance was assessed by area under receiver-operating characteristic curve. Social network analysis metrics were also used to identify providers most impactful to patient experience. Results: Using a random forest algorithm, patients' responses to the following 3 questions were predicted: "During this hospital stay how often did doctors. 1) treat you with courtesy and respect? 2) explain things in a way that you could understand? 3) listen carefully to you?" with areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.876, 0.819, and 0.819, respectively. Social network analysis found that doctors with higher centrality appear to have an outsized influence on patient experience, as measured by rank in the random forest model in the doctor domain. Conclusions: A machine learning algorithm identified patients at risk of a negative experience. Furthermore, a doctor social network framework provides metrics for identifying those providers that are most influential on the patient experience.

J	Gesell, SB; Barkin, SL; Valente, TW				Gesell, Sabina B.; Barkin, Shari L.; Valente, Thomas W.			Social network diagnostics: a tool for monitoring group interventions	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Social network analysis; Behavior change; Group interventions; Obesity	PERCEIVED COHESION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; OBESITY; RISK	Background: Many behavioral interventions designed to improve health outcomes are delivered in group settings. To date, however, group interventions have not been evaluated to determine if the groups generate interaction among members and how changes in group interaction may affect program outcomes at the individual or group level. Methods: This article presents a model and practical tool for monitoring how social ties and social structure are changing within the group during program implementation. The approach is based on social network analysis and has two phases: collecting network measurements at strategic intervention points to determine if group dynamics are evolving in ways anticipated by the intervention, and providing the results back to the group leader to guide implementation next steps. This process aims to initially increase network connectivity and ultimately accelerate the diffusion of desirable behaviors through the new network. This article presents the Social Network Diagnostic Tool and, as proof of concept, pilot data collected during the formative phase of a childhood obesity intervention. Results: The number of reported advice partners and discussion partners increased during program implementation. Density, the number of ties among people in the network expressed as a percentage of all possible ties, increased from 0.082 to 0.182 (p < 0.05) in the advice network, and from 0.027 to 0.055 (p > 0.05) in the discussion network. Conclusions: The observed two-fold increase in network density represents a significant shift in advice partners over the intervention period. Using the Social Network Tool to empirically guide program activities of an obesity intervention was feasible.

Development and validation of a questionnaire assessing the perceived control in health care among older adults with care needs in the Netherlands	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Questionnaire; Validation; Older adults; Perceived control; Health care	DECISION-MAKING; INVOLVEMENT	In response to the increased emphasis placed on older people's self-reliance in many welfare societies, we aimed to develop and validate a measurement instrument, assessing perceived control in health care among older adults with care needs. The target group consists of older people who live (semi-)independently and use professional health care, with or without informal care. Phase I (development) of the study consisted of the construction of the instrument based on the input from a variety of stakeholders. Phase II (validation) entailed a quantitative study in a sample of 247 respondents selected from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, to assess the instrument's construct validity (structural validity and hypotheses testing) and reliability (internal consistency). The questionnaire consists of 29 items, related to organizing professional care, communication with care professionals, health management in the home situation, planning (more) complex care in the future, and perceived support from the social network. Based on a factor analysis, we identified three subscales: (I.) 'perceived personal control in health care'; (II.) 'anticipated personal control regarding future health care'; and (III.) 'perceived support from the social network,' with internal consistencies varying from Cronbach's alpha = .71 to .90. Factor I was associated with mastery, self-efficacy, self-esteem (r = .31-.35) and factor III with social loneliness (r = -.42). Factor II correlated less strongly with mastery, self-efficacy, and self-esteem (r < .30). Our questionnaire revealed sufficient construct validity and internal consistency. The instrument provides a basis for further quantitative research regarding control, especially in relation to health care-related outcomes.	[Claassens, L.; Terwee, C. B.; Deeg, D. J.

Social Network Analysis of COVID-19 Sentiments: Application of Artificial Intelligence	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						COVID-19; coronavirus; sentiment; social network; Twitter; infodemiology; infodemic; pandemic; crisis; public health; business economy; artificial intelligence	CORONAVIRUS; QUARANTINE; SUPPORT; VACCINE; STRESS	Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to substantial public discussion. Understanding these discussions can help institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19. Methods: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of the tweets was also conducted. Results: There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254 (48.2%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7%) as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1%) as negative. The study identified 5 dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment, emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most positive sentiment. Conclusions: This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19 discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative.

J	McDonald, J; Jayasuriya, R; Harris, MF				McDonald, Julie; Jayasuriya, Rohan; Harris, Mark Fort			Primary health care service delivery networks for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes: using social network methods to describe interorganisational collaboration in a rural setting	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH			English	Article							COMMUNITY; AUSTRALIA	Adults with type 2 diabetes or with behavioural risk factors require comprehensive and well coordinated responses from a range of health care providers who often work in different organisational settings. This study examines three types of collaborative links between organisations involved in a rural setting. Social network methods were employed using survey data on three types of links, and data was collected from a purposive sample of 17 organisations representing the major provider types. The analysis included a mix of unconfirmed and confirmed links, and network measures. General practices were the most influential provider group in initiating referrals, and they referred to the broadest range of organisations in the network. Team care arrangements formed a small part of the general practice referral network. They were used more for access to private sector allied health care providers and less for sharing care with public sector health services. Involvement in joint programs/activities was limited to public and non-government sector services, with no participation from the private sector. The patterns of interactions suggest that informal referral networks provide access to services and coordination of care for individual patients with diabetes. Two population subgroups would benefit from more proactive approaches to ensure equitable access to services and coordination of care across organisational boundaries: people with more complex health care needs and people at risk of developing diabetes.

Multi-professional patterns and methods of communication during patient handoffs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Health information technology; Social network analysis; Communication; Multi-professional; Interdisciplinary; Handoff	PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY; SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; HEALTH-CARE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; SAFETY; SYSTEM; ERROR; MEDICINE; STAFF	Objective: Health information technology has been shown to influence the communication patterns of healthcare providers. The goal of this study was to learn more about how healthcare providers communicate and exchange patient clinical information during patient handoffs (transfers) between units in an acute care setting. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to select five patient handoffs. Questionnaires were distributed to providers identified through observation and snowball sampling. Social network analysis methodology was used to develop sociograms of the emergent communication patterns and identify the role of individual providers in the handoff process based on the number of contacts with other providers and incoming and outgoing communication activity. Individual handoff network size ranged from 11 to 20 providers. Participants were asked to describe the method of communication they used to access or share clinical information with other providers, their preferred method of communication; their satisfaction with the available options; and their suggestions for how the process could be improved. Results: The network patterns that emerged uncovered the overlapping use of synchronous and asynchronous communication methods (verbally via phone or in person; or written via paper charts and/or an electronic records). No particular professional group dominated or coordinated information flow; instead each handoff network exhibited unique communication patterns and information coordination by two or more influential providers from nursing, medicine, or pharmacy. Most (84%) participants preferred verbal communication. Overall satisfaction with the current communication process varied by unit: 82% of emergency department providers and 54% of the providers working in the admitting units stated they were satisfied or very satisfied. Recommendations for improvement included converting all units to the electronic health record, electronic handoff communication modules and asynchronous multi-professional communication logs. Conclusions: The results of this exploratory study provide a foundation for future research examining how network structure and communication principles can be used to design health information technology that compliments the non-linear information gathering and dissemination behaviors of providers from multiple professions.

Health professionals in institutions belonging to RUTE plan a program of video conferences and/or web conferences to discuss specific themes. This article presents the results of an analysis of collaboration in these SIGs. Materials and Methods: This study uses descriptive statistical analysis and visualization of data contained in management reports provided by RUTE national coordinators for the period between 2007 and 2016 to evaluate the extent of participation in SIGs between institutions associated with RUTE. In this data visualization, we employ concepts from social network theory. Results: The analysis identified the most influential institutions as measured by social network theory metrics. A small number of institutions were found to have many participating SIGs, but most had only a few participating institutions (more than 130 institutions have only one participating SIG). Over the study period, a significant quantitative growth in collaboration occurred, increasing from 21 institutions and 92 participating SIGs in 2007 to 380 institutions and 1,912 participating SIGs in 2016. Conclusion: The growth in collaboration within the network indicates increasing interest and participation in telehealth initiatives in Brazil.

We applied social network analysis methods to understand outcome co-occurrence patterns in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS systematic reviews and identify outcomes central to the network of outcomes in HIV/AIDS. Study Design and Setting: We examined all Cochrane reviews of HIV/AIDS as of June 2013. We defined a tie as two outcomes (nodes) co-occurring in >= 2 reviews. To identify central outcomes, we used normalized node betweenness centrality (nNBC) (the extent to which connections between other outcomes in a network rely on that outcome as an intermediary). We conducted a subgroup analysis by HIV/AIDS intervention type (i.e., clinical management, biomedical prevention, behavioral prevention, and health services). Results: The 140 included reviews examined 1,140 outcomes, 294 of which were unique. The most central outcome overall was all-cause mortality (nNBC = 23.9). The most central and most frequent outcomes differed overall and within subgroups. For example, "adverse events (specified)" was among the most central but not among the most frequent outcomes, overall. Conclusion: Social network analysis methods are a novel application to identify central outcomes, which provides additional information potentially useful for developing core outcome sets.

Exchanging and using research evidence in health policy networks: a statistical network analysis	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Evidence-informed health policy; Knowledge translation; Social network analysis; Exponential random graph model; Policy network	KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; MODELS; ORGANIZATIONS; STRENGTH; FEATHER; BIRDS	Background: Evidence-informed health policymaking is a goal of equitable and effective health systems but occurs infrequently in reality. Past research points to the facilitating role of interpersonal relationships between policy-makers and researchers, imploring the adoption of a social network lens. This study aims to identify network-level factors associated with the exchange and use of research evidence in policymaking. Methods: Data on social networks and research use were collected from seventy policy actors across three health policy cases in Burkina Faso (child health, malaria, and HIV). Networks were graphed for actors' interactions, their provision of, and request for research evidence. Exponential random graph models estimated the probability of evidence provision and request between actors, controlling for network-and individual-level covariates. Logistic regression models estimated actors' use of research evidence to inform policy. Results: Network structure explained more than half of the evidence exchanges (ties) observed in these networks. Across all cases, a pair of actors was more likely to form a provision tie if they already had a request tie between them and visa versa (theta = 6.16, p < 0.05; theta = 2.87, p < 0.05;. = 2.31, p < 0.05). The child health network displayed clustering tendencies, meaning that actors were more likely to form ties if they shared an acquaintance (theta = 2.36, p < 0.05). Actors' use of research evidence was positively associated with their centrality (i.e., connectedness). Conclusions: The exchange and use of research evidence in policymaking can be partly explained by the structure of actors' networks of relationships. Efforts to support knowledge translation and evidence-informed policymaking should consider network factors.

J	O'Malley, AJ				O'Malley, A. James			The analysis of social network data: an exciting frontier for statisticians	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Christakis-Fowler; dyad; network; peer effect; relationship; social influence; social selection	P-ASTERISK MODELS; EXPONENTIAL FAMILY; INFERENCE; CARE; PHYSICIANS; SELECTION; CONTAGION	The catalyst for this paper is the recent interest in the relationship between social networks and an individual's health, which has arisen following a series of papers by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler on person- to-person spread of health behaviors. In this issue, they provide a detailed explanation of their methods that offers insights, justifications, and responses to criticisms [1]. In this paper, we introduce some of the key statistical methods used in social network analysis and indicate where those used by Christakis and Fowler (CF) fit into the general framework. The intent is to provide the background necessary for readers to be able to make their own evaluation of the work by CF and understand the challenges of research involving social networks. We entertain possible solutions to some of the difficulties encountered in accounting for confounding effects in analyses of peer effects and provide comments on the contributions of CF.

Good service provision calls for interactions among these programs. The objective of this research was to discover programmatic characteristics that facilitate or impede collaboration with programs serving dissimilar age groups, among programs that serve transition-age youth. To examine this "cross-age collaboration," this research used social network analysis methods to generate homophily and heterophily scores in three communities that had received federal grants to improve services for this population. Heterophily scores (i.e., a measure of cross-age collaboration) in programs serving only transition-age youth were significantly higher than the heterophily scores of programs that served only adults or only children. Few other program markers or malleable program factors predicted heterophily. Programs that specialize in serving transition-age youth are a good resource for gaining knowledge of how to bridge adult and child programs.

Breastfeeding is a powerful intervention for population health; combined system and community interventions can increase exclusive breastfeeding rates by 2.5 times. This study examined evidence-informed decision-making within an interorganizational network, including the facilitators and barriers to achieving network goals.MethodsA mixed method case study design was used. The primary sources of data were focus group discussion and questionnaire administration. Data were analyzed concurrently using framework analysis and social network analysis.ResultsKey findings were at the interorganizational and external levels: 1) Relationships and trust are connected to knowledge exchange 2) Need for multiple levels of leadership.ConclusionsThe findings of this study have potential implications for enhancing the use of evidence-informed decision-making as other networks work toward Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI) designation and also highlights the potential for network maps to be used as a knowledge mobilization tool.

Among these, Instagram has been recently the subject of many computational social science studies. However despite Instagram's focus on image sharing, most studies have exclusively focused on the hashtag and social network structure. In this paper we perform the first large scale content analysis of Instagram posts, addressing both the image and the associated hashtags, aiming to understand the content of partially-labelled images taken in-the-wild and the relationship with hashtags that individuals use as noisy labels. In particular, we explore the possibility of learning to recognise food image content in a data driven way, discovering both the categories of food, and how to recognise them, purely from social network data. Notably, we demonstrate that our approach to food recognition can often achieve accuracies greater than 70% in recognising popular food-related image categories, despite using no manual annotation. We highlight the current capabilities and future challenges and opportunities for such data-driven analysis of image content and the relation to hashtags.

Indeed, strategies aimed at improving health-related behaviors through digital platforms can offer promising results. However, since it has been shown that peers are capable of modifying behaviors related to food and physical exercise, it is important to study whether digital interventions based on peer influence are capable of improving the weight status of adolescents. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an eHealth app in an adolescent population in terms of improvements in their age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles. Other goals of the study were to examine the social relationships of adolescents pre- and postintervention, and to identify the group leaders and study their profiles, eating and physical activity habits, and use of the web app. Methods: The BMI percentiles were calculated in accordance with the reference guidelines of the World Health Organization. Participants' diets and levels of physical activity were assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (KIDMED) questionnaire and the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A), respectively. The variables related to social networks were analyzed using the social network analysis (SNA) methodology. In this respect, peer relationships that were considered reciprocal friendships were used to compute the "degree" measure, which was used as an indicative parameter of centrality. Results: The sample population comprised 210 individuals in the intervention group (IG) and 91 individuals in the control group (CG). A participation rate of 60.1% (301/501) was obtained. After checking for homogeneity between the IG and the CG, it was found that adolescents in the IG at BMI percentiles both below and above the 50th percentile (P50) modified their BMI to approach this reference value (with a significance of P<.001 among individuals with an initial BMI below the P50 and P=.04 for those with an initial BMI above the P50). The diet was also improved in the IG compared with the CG (P<.001). After verifying that the social network had increased postintervention, it was seen that the group leaders (according to the degree SNA measure) were also leaders in physical activity performed (P=.002) and use of the app. Conclusions: The eHealth app was able to modify behaviors related to P50 compliance and exert a positive influence in relation to diet and physical exercise.

Social media usage is growing rapidly and has become the new norm of communication. It is imperative to examine what is being discussed in the social media about diseases or conditions and the characteristics of the network of people involved in discussion. The objective is to assess the tools and techniques used to study social media disease networks using network analysis and network modeling. PubMed and IEEEXplore were searched from 2009 to 2020 and included 30 studies after screening and analysis. Twitter, QuitNet, and disease-specific online forums were widely used to study communications on various health conditions. Most of the studies have performed content analysis and network analysis, whereas network modeling has been done in six studies. Posts on cancer, COVID-19, and smoking have been widely studied. Tools and techniques used for network analysis are listed. Health-related social media data can be leveraged for network analysis. Network modeling technique would help to identify the structural factors associated with the affiliation of the disease networks, which is scarcely utilized. This will help public health professionals to tailor targeted interventions.

To identify how information and communication needs evolve with the aging process, we created a living laboratory of families, supported by an online private social network with tools for care coordination. Site registrants are invite to participate in a more in-depth survey-based longitudinal study. In year one, we assessed the feasibility of an online living laboratory. During this first year, 155 individuals registered on InfoSAGE, and 26% opted into the more in-depth longitudinal study. The survey response rate for those in the study was 61%. We present here a descriptive analysis of our early participants and networks, as well as barriers to participation that the study team encountered.

We conducted two case studies of chronic illness service partnerships in 2007 and 2008 to determine whether participatory research incorporating social network analysis is acceptable for problem-solving in Australian Aboriginal health service delivery. Methods: Local research groups comprising 13-19 partnership staff, policy officers and community members were established at each of two sites to guide the research and to reflect and act on the findings. Network and work practice surveys were conducted with 42 staff, and the results were fed back to the research groups. At the end of the project, 19 informants at the two sites were interviewed, and the researchers conducted critical reflection. The effectiveness and acceptability of the participatory social network method were determined quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: Participants in both local research groups considered that the network survey had accurately described the links between workers related to the exchange of clinical and cultural information, team care relationships, involvement in service management and planning and involvement in policy development. This revealed the function of the teams and the roles of workers in each partnership. Aboriginal workers had a high number of direct links in the exchange of cultural information, illustrating their role as the cultural resource, whereas they had fewer direct links with other network members on clinical information exchange and team care. The problem of their current and future roles was discussed inside and outside the local research groups. According to the interview informants the participatory network analysis had opened the way for problem-solving by "putting issues on the table". While there were confronting and ethically challenging aspects, these informants considered that with flexibility of data collection to account for the preferences of Aboriginal members, then the method was appropriate in cross-cultural contexts for the difficult discussions that are needed to improve partnerships. Conclusion: Critical reflection showed that the preconditions for difficult discussions are, first, that partners have the capacity to engage in such discussions, second, that partners assess whether the effort required for these discussions is balanced by the benefits they gain from the partnership, and, third, that " boundary spanning" staff can facilitate commitment to partnership goals.

Examining the interactions of participants in health-related social media groups can help inform our understanding of how these groups can best be leveraged to facilitate behavior change. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze patterns of participation, self-reported smoking cessation length, and interactions within the National Cancer Institutes' Facebook community for smoking cessation support. Methods: Our sample consisted of approximately 4243 individuals who interacted (eg, posted, commented) on the public Smokefree Women Facebook page during the time of data collection. In Phase 1, social network visualizations and centrality measures were used to evaluate network structure and engagement. In Phase 2, an inductive, thematic qualitative content analysis was conducted with a subsample of 500 individuals, and correlational analysis was used to determine how participant engagement was associated with self-reported session length. Results: Between February 2013 and March 2014, there were 875 posts and 4088 comments from approximately 4243 participants. Social network visualizations revealed the moderator's role in keeping the community together and distributing the most active participants. Correlation analyses suggest that engagement in the network was significantly inversely associated with cessation status (Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.14, P=.03, N=243). The content analysis of 1698 posts from 500 randomly selected participants identified the most frequent interactions in the community as providing support (43%, n=721) and announcing number of days smoke free (41%, n=689). Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of the moderator for network engagement and provide helpful insights into the patterns and types of interactions participants are engaging in. This study adds knowledge of how the social network of a smoking cessation community behaves within the confines of a Facebook group.

Networking Matters: A Social Network Analysis of the Association of Program Directors of Internal Medicine	TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE			English	Article						medical education-postgraduate; continuing professional development; organizational behavior; social science	EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS PROJECT; HEALTH-CARE; PHYSICIANS; COMMUNITY; SPREAD	Theory: Networking has positive effects on career development; however, personal characteristics of group members such as gender or diversity may foster or hinder member connectedness. Social network analysis explores interrelationships between people in groups by measuring the strength of connection between all possible pairs in a given network. Social network analysis has rarely been used to examine network connections among members in an academic medical society. This study seeks to ascertain the strength of connection between program directors in the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) and its Education Innovations Project subgroup and to examine possible associations between connectedness and characteristics of program directors and programs. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that connectedness will be measurable within a large academic medical society and will vary significantly for program directors with certain measurable characteristics (e.g., age, gender, rank, location, burnout levels, desire to resign). Method: APDIM program directors described levels of connectedness to one another on the 2012 APDIM survey. Using social network analysis, we ascertained program director connectedness by measuring out-degree centrality, in-degree centrality, and eigenvector centrality, all common measures of connectedness. Results: Higher centrality was associated with completion of the APDIM survey, being in a university-based program, Educational Innovations Project participation, and higher academic rank. Centrality did not vary by gender; international medical graduate status; previous chief resident status; program region; or levels of reported program director burnout, callousness, or desire to resign. Conclusions: In this social network analysis of program directors within a large academic medical society, we found that connectedness was related to higher academic rank and certain program characteristics but not to other program director characteristics like gender or international medical graduate status. Further research is needed to optimize our understanding of connection in organizations such as these and to determine which strategies promote valuable connections.

J	Playford, DE; Burkitt, T; Atkinson, D				Playford, Denese E.; Burkitt, Tessa; Atkinson, David			Social network analysis of rural medical networks after medical school immersion in a rural clinical school	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Rural clinical school; Rural; Medical; Workforce; Social network analysis; Recruitment	HEALTH-CARE; RETENTION; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; REMOTE; RECRUITMENT; AUSTRALIA; WORKFORCE	BackgroundThe impact of new medical graduates on the social dimensions of the rural medical workforce is yet to be examined. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is able to visualize and measure these dimensions. We apply this method to examine the workforce characteristics of graduates from a representative Australian Rural Clinical School.MethodsParticipants were medical graduates of the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia (RCSWA) from the 2001-2014 cohorts, identified as being in rural work in 2017 by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. SNA was used to examine the relationships between site of origin and of work destination. Data were entered into UCInet 6 as tied pairs, and visualized using Netdraw. UCINet statistics relating to node centrality were obtained from the node editor.ResultsSNA measures showed that the 124 of 709 graduates in rural practice were distributed around Australia, and that their practice was strongly focused on the North, with a clear centre in the remote Western Australian town of Broome. Women were strongly recruited, and were widely distributed.ConclusionsRCSWA appears to be a weak tie according to SNA theory: the School attracts graduates to rural nodes where they had only passing prior contact. The multiple activities that comprise the social capital of the most attractive, remote, node demonstrate the clear workforce effects of being a bridge, broker and boundary spanner in SNA terms, and add new understanding about recruiting to the rural workforce.

Methods: The methodology is based a filling of a questionnaire about offer or demand. Material is composed a computer connected Internet. Result: we registered about 203 demands and 31 offers from partners.43 mobilities were executed completely. Conclusion: The results indicate a real need of mobility for researchers and health professionals in Africa. The important number of mobility demands made by external researchers and professionals (from outside the AFRICA BUILD Consortium) may be constrained by the difficulty to find adequate funding.

These platforms provide free, open and wide-sourced places for people to publicly discuss health-related problems, especially some mental health problems, such as depression. This paper aims to characterize the unique structural and dynamic patterns of users' interactions in depression related OHCs. Through the topological analyses of social networks, we identify the unique highly sticky structure of depression related OHCs as compared with other social communities. Besides, users in these communities spend relatively longer time on closely peer-to-peer messaging. Moreover, the evolutionary trends show that depression related OHCs present distinctive growth patterns in terms of user addition and user activeness, which could be further applied in differentiating the community types and the development stages.

Previous studies have also documented the relationship between professional networks and physicians' attitudes toward evidence-based medicine (EBM). The present study sought associations between physicians' self-reported attitudes toward EBM and the formation of inter-physician collaborative network ties. Methods: Primary data were collected from 297 clinicians at six hospitals belonging to one of the largest local health units of the Italian National Health Service. Data collection used a survey questionnaire that inquired about professional networks and physicians' characteristics. Social network analysis was performed to describe inter-physician professional networks. Multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures were performed to assess the relationship between self-reported attitudes toward EBM and clinicians' propensity to collaborate. Results: Physicians who reported similar attitudes toward EBM were more likely to exchange information and advice through collaborative relationships (beta = 0.0198; p < 0.05). Similarities in other characteristics, such as field of specialization (beta = 0.1988; p < 0.01), individual affiliations with hospital sites (beta = 0.0845; p < 0.01), and organizational clinical directorates (beta = 0.0459; p < 0.01), were also significantly related to physicians' propensity to collaborate. Conclusions: Communities of practice within healthcare organizations are likely to contain separate clusters of physicians whose members are highly similar. Organizational interventions are needed to foster heterophily whenever multidisciplinary cooperation is required to provide effective health care.

State and non-state mental health service collaboration is a recognized strategy to increase access to care and optimal use of community resources, but little evidence exist about how it unfolds in low-to middle-income countries. South Africa's Mental Health Policy Framework and Strategic Plan 2013-20 (MHPF) underlines the importance of collaborative public mental health care, though it is unclear how and to what extent this happens. The aim of the study was to explore the extent and nature of state and non-state mental health service collaboration in the Mangaung Metropolitan District, Free State, South Africa. The research involved an equal status, sequential mixed methods design, comprised of social network analysis (SNA) and semi-structured interviews. SNA-structured interviews were conducted with collaborating state and non-state mental health service providers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with collaborating partners and key stake holders. Descriptive network analyses of the SNA data were performed with Gephi, and thematic analysis of the semi-structured interview data were performed in NVivo. SNA results suggested a fragmented, hospital centric network, with low average density and clustering, and high authority and influence of a specialist psychiatric hospital. Several different types of collaborative interactions emerged, of which housing and treatment adherence a key point of collaboration. Proportional interactions between state and non-state services were low. Qualitative data expanded on these findings, highlighting the range of available mental health services, and pointed to power dynamics as an important consideration in the mental health service network. The fostering of a well-integrated system of care as proposed in the MHPF requires inter-institutional arrangements that include both clinical and social facets of care, and improvements in local governance.

Demographic and Indication-Specific Characteristics Have Limited Association With Social Network Engagement: Evidence From 24,954 Members of Four Health Care Support Groups	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						econometric models; social networking; social support; self-help groups; data mining; Internet; regression analysis; forecasting; superusers		Background: Digital health social networks (DHSNs) are widespread, and the consensus is that they contribute to wellness by offering social support and knowledge sharing. The success of a DHSN is based on the number of participants and their consistent creation of externalities through the generation of new content. To promote network growth, it would be helpful to identify characteristics of superusers or actors who create value by generating positive network externalities. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of developing predictive models that identify potential superusers in real time. This study examined associations between posting behavior, 4 demographic variables, and 20 indication-specific variables. Methods: Data were extracted from the custom structured query language (SQL) databases of 4 digital health behavior change interventions with DHSNs. Of these, 2 were designed to assist in the treatment of addictions (problem drinking and smoking cessation), and 2 for mental health (depressive disorder, panic disorder). To analyze posting behavior, 10 models were developed, and negative binomial regressions were conducted to examine associations between number of posts, and demographic and indication-specific variables. Results: The DHSNs varied in number of days active (3658-5210), number of registrants (5049-52,396), number of actors (1085-8452), and number of posts (16,231-521,997). In the sample, all 10 models had low R-2 values (.013-.086) with limited statistically significant demographic and indication-specific variables. Conclusions: Very few variables were associated with social network engagement. Although some variables were statistically significant, they did not appear to be practically significant. Based on the large number of study participants, variation in DHSN theme, and extensive time-period, we did not find strong evidence that demographic characteristics or indication severity sufficiently explain the variability in number of posts per actor. Researchers should investigate alternative models that identify superusers or other individuals who create social network externalities.

Many people use online support groups and communities to seek and provide social support. It is essential to examine how users' participation behaviors may contribute to different outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to (1) use the structural positions of online depression forum users in their reply network to predict received support and (2) examine their language use reflecting their health conditions. Methods: A total of 2061 users and their 62,274 replies posted on a depression forum from July 2004 to July 2014 were extracted using a web crawler written in Python. The content of the forum users' posts and replies and their reply patterns were examined. A social network analysis method was used to build the reply networks of users. The computerized text analysis method was used to measure features of the forum users' language styles. Results: Forum users' bridging social capital (operationalized as network betweenness) was positively associated with the level of communication accommodation in their received replies (P=.04). Forum users' bonding social capital (operationalized as network constraint) was negatively associated with the level of communication accommodation in their received replies (P<.001). The forum users' change in their use of self-referent words and words expressing negative emotions were examined as linguistic proxies for their health conditions and mental states. The results revealed a general negative association between the number of received replies and the degree of decrease in the use of words expressing negative emotion (P=.007). Conclusions: The structural positions of online depression forum users in the reply network are associated with different participation outcomes in the users. Thus, receiving replies can be beneficial to online depression forum users.

J	Erfani, SS; Blount, Y; Abedin, B				Erfani, Seyedezahra Shadi; Blount, Yvette; Abedin, Babak			The influence of health-specific social network site use on the psychological well-being of cancer-affected people	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Social network sites; Facebook; cancer-affected people; psychological well-being; social support; social connectedness; learning; social presence	BREAST-CANCER; FACEBOOK FRIENDS; SUPPORT; CONNECTEDNESS; COMMUNITY; BENEFITS; WOMEN; INTERVENTION; SATISFACTION; BEHAVIORS	Objective We aimed to explore and examine how and in what ways the use of social network sites (SNSs) can improve health outcomes, specifically better psychological well-being, for cancer-affected people. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with users of the Ovarian Cancer Australia Facebook page (OCA Facebook), the exemplar SNS used in this study. Twenty-five women affected by ovarian cancer who were users of OCA Facebook were interviewed. A multi-theory perspective was employed to interpret the data. Results Most of the study participants used OCA Facebook daily. Some users were passive and only observed created content, while other users actively posted content and communicated with other members. Analysis showed that the use of this SNS enhanced social support for users, improved the users' experiences of social connectedness, and helped users learn and develop social presence, which ultimately improved their psychological well-being. Discussion The strong theoretical underpinning of our research and empirically derived results led to a new understanding of the capacity of SNSs to improve psychological well-being. Our study provides evidence showing how the integration of these tools into existing health services can enhance patients' psychological well-being. This study also contributes to the body of knowledge on the implications of SNS use for improving the psychological well-being of cancer-affected people. Conclusion This research assessed the relationship between the use of SNSs, specifically OCA Facebook, and the psychological well-being of cancer-affected people. The study confirmed that using OCA Facebook can improve psychological well-being by demonstrating the potential value of SNSs as a support service in the healthcare industry.

Using social network analysis to explore academic research-to-policy networks from six schools of public health in Kenya	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Evidence-informed decision-making; evidence-to-policy; Kenya; knowledge broker; schools of public health; social network analysis	PARTNERSHIPS; SCIENTISTS; MAKERS	The potential for academic research institutions to facilitate knowledge exchange and influence evidence-informed decision-making has been gaining ground. Schools of public health (SPHs) may play a key knowledge brokering role-serving as agencies of and for development. Understanding academic-policymaker networks can facilitate the enhancement of links between policymakers and academic faculty at SPHs, as well as assist in identifying academic knowledge brokers (KBs). Using a census approach, we administered a sociometric survey to academic faculty across six SPHs in Kenya to construct academic-policymaker networks. We identified academic KBs using social network analysis (SNA) in a two-step approach: First, we ranked individuals based on (1) number of policymakers in their network; (2) number of academic peers who report seeking them out for advice on knowledge translation and (3) their network position as 'inter-group connectors'. Second, we triangulated the three scores and re-ranked individuals. Academic faculty scoring within the top decile across all three measures were classified as KBs. Results indicate that each SPH commands a variety of unique as well as overlapping relationships with national ministries in Kenya. Of 124 full-time faculty, we identified 7 KBs in 4 of the 6 SPHs. Those scoring high on the first measure were not necessarily the same individuals scoring high on the second. KBs were also situated in a wide range along the 'connector/betweenness' measure. We propose that a composite score rather than traditional 'betweenness centrality', provides an alternative means of identifying KBs within these networks. In conclusion, SNA is a valuable tool for identifying academic-policymaker networks in Kenya. More efforts to conduct similar network studies would permit SPH leadership to identify existing linkages between faculty and policymakers, shared linkages with other SPHs and gaps so as to contribute to evidence-informed health policies.

Theory-guided research examining how individual- and community-level factors influence health behaviors and contribute to disparities is needed. OBJECTIVE: To understand how a social network model that captures the interplay between individual and community factors might inform community-based interventions to reduce HIV risk in rural AA communities. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Eleven focus groups with 38 AA 16-24 year olds, 42 adults over age 25, and 13 formerly incarcerated individuals held in community settings in two rural, predominantly AA counties in North Carolina. Thirty-seven semi-structured interviews with multiethnic key informants. APPROACH: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with open-ended questions assessed a) perceptions of multi-level HIV risk determinants from a social network model (individual, interpersonal, social, economic, political and structural) identified through literature review and b) community needs and assets affecting local HIV rates. Qualitative data was analyzed using directive content analysis guided by a social network model. RESULTS: We identified four themes regarding the interaction between individuals and their communities that mediate HIV risk: interpersonal processes, community structural environment, social disorder, and civic engagement. Communities were characterized as having a high degree of cohesiveness, tension, and HIV-related stigma. The community structural environment-characterized by neighborhood poverty, lack of skilled jobs, segregation, political disenfranchisement and institutional racism-was felt to reduce the availability and accessibility of resources to combat HIV. Adults noted an inability to combat social problems due to social disorder, which fuels HIV risk behaviors. Civic engagement as a means of identifying community concerns and developing solutions is limited by churches' reluctance to address HIV-related issues. CONCLUSION: To combat HIV-related stigma, physicians should follow recommendations for universal HIV testing. Besides asking about individual health behaviors, physicians should ask about the availability of support and local community resources. Physicians might consider tailoring their treatment recommendations based on available community resources. This strategy may potentially improve patient adherence and clinical outcomes.

Understanding the structure of this network cannot only help analyze common clinical protocols but can also help reveal previously unknown patterns of care. The objective of this research is to introduce the concept and methods for constructing and analyzing the network of medical care services. We start by demonstrating how to build the network itself and then develop algorithms, based on principal component analysis and social network analysis, to detect communities of services. Finally, we propose novel graphical techniques for representing and assessing patterns of care. We demonstrate the application of our algorithms using data from an Emergency Department in New York State. One of the implications of our research is that clinical experts could use our algorithms to detect deviations from either existing protocols of care or administrative norms.

Several methods have been developed to solve health insurance fraud; however, these methods are like a rule-based mechanism. Without exploring the behavior patterns, these methods are time-consuming and ineffective; in addition, they are inadequate for managing the fraudulent dentists. Methods: Based on social network theory, we develop an evaluation approach to solve the problem of cross-dentist fraud. The trustworthiness score of a dentist is calculated based upon the amount and type of dental operations performed on the same patient and the same tooth by that dentist and other dentists. Results: The simulation provides the following evidence. (1) This specific type of fraud can be identified effectively using our evaluation approach. (2) A retrospective study for the claims is also performed. (3) The proposed method is effective in identifying the fraudulent dentists. Conclusions: We provide a new direction for investigating the genuineness of claims data. If the insurer can detect fraudulent dentists using the traditional method and the proposed method simultaneously. the detection will be more transparent and ultimately reduce the losses caused by fraudulent daims.

In this respect, the so-called transition age between 55 and 75 is crucial for individual health and wellbeing, since it usually is connected with the transition from work life to retirement. This leads to a fundamental change in daily routines and social life, often causing mental or physical health problems. Online Social Networks have been studied for some time already as a means for supporting social inclusion of elderly people. On the other hand, by healthcare providers and welfare organizations an increasing number of support services for elderly people are or will be provided also online in the future. However, the combination of both aspects in order to provide a more holistic online support for elderly people, in particular to those between 55-75, has not been discussed so far. Therefore, in this paper we argue in favor of the concept of an integrated online service and social network for elderly people and present an outline of its intended functionality.

This study tested a model of help-seeking behavior among three ethnically different immigrant groups. Participants were 1356 Somali, Russian, and Kurdish immigrants (18-64years). They reported past traumatic events, social network, acculturation indices, trust in services, and mental health as well as usage of mental and somatic health services. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with multigroup procedure was applied. First, past traumatic events were associated with seeking more mental health services, indirectly mediated through increased risk for mental health problems in all three ethnic groups. Second, acculturation played a significant role in the use of mental and somatic health services only in Kurds and social networks in Kurds and Russians. The unique culturally influenced dynamics in help-seeking behavior should be considered in the development of health services.

It has important implications for ongoing efforts to support Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in the health professions. However, the challenge of analysing the data generated in OSNs makes it difficult to understand whether and how they are useful for CPD. This paper presents a conceptual model for using mixed methods to study data from OSNs to examine the efficacy of OSN in supporting informal learning of health professionals. It is expected that using this model with the dataset generated in OSNs for informal learning will produce new and important insights into how well this innovation in CPD is serving professionals and the healthcare system.

However, there have been insufficient studies using n machine learning methods that can maximize the utility of such information. Leveraging a state-of-the-art network topology modeling method, graph convolutional networks (GCN), our main objective was to include network information for the task of detecting previously unknown HIV infections. Materials and Methods: We used multiple social network data (peer referral, social, sex partners, and affiliation with social and health venues) that include 378 young men who had sex with men in Houston, TX, collected between 2014 and 2016. Due to the limited sample size, an ensemble approach was engaged by integrating GCN for modeling information flow and statistical machine learning methods, including random forest and logistic regression, to efficiently model sparse features in individual nodes. Results: Modeling network information using GCN effectively increased the prediction of HIV status in the social network. The ensemble approach achieved 96.6% on accuracy and 94.6% on F1 measure, which outperformed the baseline methods (GCN, logistic regression, and random forest: 79.0%, 90.5%, 94.4% on accuracy, respectively; and 57.7%, 80.2%, 90.4% on F1). In the networks with missing HIV status, the ensemble also produced promising results. Conclusion: Network context is a necessary component in modeling infectious disease transmissions such as HIV. GCN, when combined with traditional machine learning approaches, achieved promising performance in detecting previously unknown HIV infections, which may provide a useful tool for combatting the HIV epidemic.

Social networks and physician adoption of electronic health records: insights from an empirical study	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; USER ACCEPTANCE; OPINION LEADERS; ORDER ENTRY; CARE; ATTITUDES; FRIENDSHIP; PROFESSIONALS; CONSEQUENCES	Objective To study how social interactions influence physician adoption of an electronic health records (EHA) system. Design A social network survey was used to delineate the structure of social interactions among 40 residents and 15 attending physicians in an ambulatory primary care practice. Social network analysis was then applied to relate the interaction structures to individual physicians' utilization rates of an EHR system. Measurements The social network survey assessed three distinct types of interaction structures: professional network based on consultation on patient care-related matters; friendship network based on personal intimacy; and perceived influence network based on a person's perception of how other people have affected her intention to adopt the EHA system. EHR utilization rates were measured as the proportion of patient visits in which sentinel use events consisting of patient data documentation or retrieval activities were recorded. The usage data were collected over a time period of 14 months from computer-recorded audit trail logs. Results Neither the professional nor the perceived influence network is correlated with EHR usage. The structure of the friendship network significantly influenced individual physicians' adoption of the EHR system. Residents who occupied similar social positions in the friendship network shared similar EHR utilization rates (p<0.05). In other words, residents who had personal friends in common tended to develop comparable levels of EHR adoption. This effect is particularly prominent when the mutual personal friends of these 'socially similar' residents were attending physicians (p<0.001). Conclusions Social influence affecting physician adoption of EHR seems to be predominantly conveyed through interactions with personal friends rather than interactions in professional settings.

Individual and Network Correlates of Antisocial Personality Disorder Among Rural Nonmedical Prescription Opioid Users	JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH			English	Article						antisocial personality disorder; drug abuse; nonmedical prescription drug use; rural; social network analysis	INJECTION-DRUG USERS; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW MINI; NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; HIV RISK BEHAVIORS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY; MENTAL-DISORDERS; FOLLOW-UP; DSM-IV; INTERPERSONAL DYSFUNCTION	Purpose: Examination of the association of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) with substance use and HIV risk behaviors within the social networks of rural people who use drugs. Methods: Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to assess substance use, HIV risk behavior, and social network characteristics of drug users (n = 503) living in rural Appalachia. The MINI International Psychiatric Interview was used to determine whether participants met DSM-IV criteria for ASPD and Axis-I psychological comorbidities (eg, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder). Participants were also tested for herpes simplex 2, hepatitis C, and HIV. Multivariate generalized linear mixed modeling was used to determine the association between ASPD and risk behaviors, substance use, and social network characteristics. Results: Approximately one-third (31%) of participants met DSM-IV criteria for ASPD. In multivariate analysis, distrust and conflict within an individual's social networks, as well as past 30-day use of heroin and crack, male gender, younger age, lesser education, heterosexual orientation, and comorbid MDD were associated with meeting diagnostic criteria for ASPD. Conclusions: Participants meeting criteria for ASPD were more likely to report recent heroin and crack use, which are far less common drugs of abuse in this population in which the predominant drug of abuse is prescription opioids. Greater discord within relationships was also identified among those with ASPD symptomatology. Given the elevated risk for blood-borne infection (eg, HIV) and other negative social and health consequences conferred by this high-risk subgroup, exploration of tailored network-based interventions with mental health assessment is recommended.

A social network of hospital acquired infection built from electronic medical record data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS; MODEL; COLONIZATION; INFLUENZA; OUTBREAKS; SPREAD; IMPACT	Objective Social networks have been used in the study of outbreaks of infectious diseases, including in small group settings such as individual hospitals. Collecting the data needed to create such networks, however, can be time consuming, costly, and error prone. We sought to create a social network of hospital inpatients using electronic medical record (EMR) data already collected for other purposes, for use in simulating outbreaks of nosocomial infections. Materials and methods We used the EMR data warehouse of a tertiary academic hospital to model contact among inpatients. Patient-to-patient contact due to shared rooms was inferred from admission-discharge-transfer data, and contact with healthcare workers was inferred from clinical documents. Contacts were used to generate a social network, which was then used to conduct probabilistic simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and influenza. Results Simulations of infection transmission across the network reflected the staffing and patient flow practices of the hospital. Simulations modeling patient isolation, increased hand hygiene, and staff vaccination showed a decrease in the spread of infection. Discussion We developed a method of generating a social network of hospital inpatients from EMR data. This method allows the derivation of networks that reflect the local hospital environment, obviate the need for simulated or manually collected data, and can be updated in near real time. Conclusions Inpatient social networks represent a novel secondary use of EMR data, and can be used to simulate nosocomial infections. Future work should focus on prospective validation of the simulations, and adapting such networks to other tasks.

HealthTrust: A Social Network Approach for Retrieving Online Health Videos	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Medical informatics; information storage and retrieval; video; online systems; health communication; diabetes	QUALITY CRITERIA; INFORMATION; INTERNET; WEB; IMPROVE; SEARCH	Background: Social media are becoming mainstream in the health domain. Despite the large volume of accurate and trustworthy health information available on social media platforms, finding good-quality health information can be difficult. Misleading health information can often be popular (eg, antivaccination videos) and therefore highly rated by general search engines. We believe that community wisdom about the quality of health information can be harnessed to help create tools for retrieving good-quality social media content. Objectives: To explore approaches for extracting metrics about authoritativeness in online health communities and how these metrics positively correlate with the quality of the content. Methods: We designed a metric, called HealthTrust, that estimates the trustworthiness of social media content (eg, blog posts or videos) in a health community. The HealthTrust metric calculates reputation in an online health community based on link analysis. We used the metric to retrieve YouTube videos and channels about diabetes. In two different experiments, health consumers provided 427 ratings of 17 videos and professionals gave 162 ratings of 23 videos. In addition, two professionals reviewed 30 diabetes channels. Results: HealthTrust may be used for retrieving online videos on diabetes, since it performed better than YouTube Search in most cases. Overall, of 20 potential channels, HealthTrust's filtering allowed only 3 bad channels (15%) versus 8 (40%) on the YouTube list. Misleading and graphic videos (eg, featuring amputations) were more commonly found by YouTube Search than by searches based on HealthTrust. However, some videos from trusted sources had low HealthTrust scores, mostly from general health content providers, and therefore not highly connected in the diabetes community. When comparing video ratings from our reviewers, we found that HealthTrust achieved a positive and statistically significant correlation with professionals (Pearson r(10) = .65, P = .02) and a trend toward significance with health consumers (r(7) = .65, P = .06) with videos on hemoglobinA(1c), but it did not perform as well with diabetic foot videos. Conclusions: The trust-based metric HealthTrust showed promising results when used to retrieve diabetes content from YouTube. Our research indicates that social network analysis may be used to identify trustworthy social media in health communities.

This purpose is best served if the vocabulary evolves with consumers' language. Objective: Our objective was to create a computer assisted update (CAU) system that works with live corpora to identify new candidate terms for inclusion in the open access and collaborative (OAC) CHV. Methods: The CAU system consisted of three main parts: a Web crawler and an HTML parser, a candidate term filter that utilizes natural language processing tools including term recognition methods, and a human review interface. In evaluation, the CAU system was applied to the health-related social network website PatientsLikeMe.com. The system's utility was assessed by comparing the candidate term list it generated to a list of valid terms hand extracted from the text of the crawled webpages. Results: The CAU system identified 88,994 unique terms 1- to 7-grams ("n-grams" are n consecutive words within a sentence) in 300 crawled PatientsLikeMe.com webpages. The manual review of the crawled webpages identified 651 valid terms not yet included in the OAC CHV or the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus, a collection of vocabularies amalgamated to form an ontology of medical terms, (ie, 1 valid term per 136.7 candidate n-grams). The term filter selected 774 candidate terms, of which 237 were valid terms, that is, 1 valid term among every 3 or 4 candidates reviewed. Conclusion: The CAU system is effective for generating a list of candidate terms for human review during CHV development.

From a healthcare perspective, process improvement models have mainly focused on the static workflow viewpoint. The objective of this article is to study and model the dynamic nature of healthcare delivery, allowing us to identify where potential issues exist within the service system and to examine how Connected Health technological solutions may support service efficiencies. We explore the application of social network analysis (SNA) as a modelling technique which captures the dynamic nature of a healthcare service. We demonstrate how it can be used to map the 'Careflow Network' and guide Connected Health innovators to examine specific opportunities within the healthcare service. Our results indicate that healthcare technology must be correctly identified and implemented within the Careflow Network to enjoy improvements in service delivery. Oftentimes, prior to making the transformation to Connected Health, researchers use various modelling techniques that fail to identify where Connected Health innovation is best placed in a healthcare service network. Using SNA allows us to develop an understanding of the current operation of healthcare system within which they can effect change. It is important to identify and model the resource exchanges to ensure that the quality and safety of care are enhanced, efficiencies are increased and the overall healthcare service system is improved. We have shown that dynamic models allow us to study the exchange of resources. These are often intertwined within a socio-technical context in an informal manner and not accounted for in static models, yet capture a truer insight on the operations of a Careflow Network.

Internet Use in Old Age: Results of a German Population-Representative Survey	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						internet use; epidemiology; old age; health services; eHealth	GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; COMPUTER USE; HEALTH-CARE; SENIOR-CITIZENS; SOCIAL NETWORK; ADULTS; TECHNOLOGY; LONELINESS	Background: The internet has the potential to foster healthy lifestyles and to support chronic disease management. Older adults could benefit from using the internet and other information and communication technology to access health-related information and interventions available online. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate factors influencing internet use in older and oldest age groups and to determine the frequency of internet use for health-related purposes. Methods: Using data from a nationally representative telephone survey of older adults aged 75 years and over, a sample of 999 people was assessed using structured clinical interviews. Descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: Overall, 42.6% (418/999) of participants used the internet. Among those, 55.7% (233/417) searched the internet for health-related information. Regression analyses revealed that internet use was significantly associated with younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.92; P<.001), male gender (OR 2.84, 95% CI 2.02-4.00; P<.001), higher education levels (OR 6.69, 95% CI 4.48-9.99; P<.001), a wider social network (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; P=.01), higher health-related quality of life (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.03; P=.006), lower levels of depressive symptoms (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99; P=.04), and higher rates of chronic illness (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.21; P<.004). Conclusions: This study provides population-representative data on internet use in old age in Germany. People in the older and oldest age groups participate in online activities. Understanding the factors that are associated with older adults internet use can contribute to developing tailored interventions and eHealth (electronic health) services to improve well-being in older adults.

Gamified web applications should be valued for sexual health education, and thus STDs prevention, for their potential to get users engaged and involved with their healthcare. Aiming to achieve that youngsters become more aware of STDs we have developed "sjekkdeg.no", a gamified web application focused on sexual health targeting North-Norwegian youngsters. Gamification techniques like avatars, achievement-based gifts and social network sharing buttons have been implemented in the site that includes educational content on sexual health and a STDs symptom checker. Preliminary results show that the game-style web app could be useful to encourage users to learn more on sexual health and STDs and thus changing their risky behaviors and preventing sexually transmitted diseases.

Recently, more and more research attention has been paid to this area, from clinic data analysis to patient record management. If we say the e-health has been mainly dealing with patient data analysis and various disease diagnosis at its early time, nowadays various data sources, such as social network, physician and patients' blogs, and various monitoring data (like sensors attached to PD patients at home) are widely used for aid of better disease diagnosis through gathering richer experts' knowledge and expertise, richer data (from patients, diseases, diagnosis, medical experiments, etc.) for analysis, and quicker (or better timely) access to various resources (e.g. telemedicine) pervasively.

J	Jones, EC; Storksdieck, M				Jones, Eric C.; Storksdieck, Martin			Recent research on the social network concept and cancer	CURRENT OPINION IN SUPPORTIVE AND PALLIATIVE CARE			English	Review						cancer; social determinants; social network analysis	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BREAST-CANCER; PROSTATE-CANCER; SURVIVORS; SUPPORT; DIAGNOSIS; SEEKING; MEDIA; GAY	Purpose of review This review covers articles in 2018 and early 2019 that employed the concept of networks and social interactions in research on how patients with cancer cope, receive and respond to medical treatment and allied support. The use of social aspects, and more formally the method of social network analysis for research on social aspects of cancer is quite new. Although we paid special attention to articles that used formal social network analysis, we noted that those articles cover just over a quarter of the material we reviewed. Most articles that incorporated social aspects of cancer did not intend to formalize those aspects but treated the network concept as a way to characterize social support, social influence, or social responsibilities. Recent findings We identified 74 recent articles that mentioned the network concept for research about cancer, excluding gene interaction networks. Of those 74 articles, 21 measured specific relationships between individuals or organizations and/or attributes of those individuals or organizations connected to participants or to others. Primary foci of the network analysis and nonnetwork analysis studies were breast cancer, social support for patients, and they usually at least considered sex and age of the cancer patients/survivors. Social media received some attention, and there were some studies considering quality of life and mental health. Among network analysis studies, size of network and number of people providing emotional/informational/instrumental support occurred in more than a couple studies but not the majority. There was little similarity among studies - whether using network analysis or not - suggesting that theory building and methodological development are in early stages. Summary Implications of the review include opportunities for more systematic research using the network concept to understand people's experience of cancer as well as research on cancer. Researchers can make considerable contributions at this stage in the field's development, and practitioners can help develop interventions that make fuller use of the insights of social network analysis.

J	Magnezi, R; Bergman, YS; Grosberg, D				Magnezi, Racheli; Bergman, Yoav S.; Grosberg, Dafna			Online Activity and Participation in Treatment Affects the Perceived Efficacy of Social Health Networks Among Patients With Chronic Illness	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Internet; social health network; Patient Activation Measure (PAM); online health network	DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT; ACTIVATION MEASURE; INTERNET USE; PRIMARY-CARE; INFORMATION; OUTCOMES; ADULTS; INTERVENTION; PATERNALISM; SUPPORT	Background: The use of online health-related social networks for support, peer-to-peer connections, and obtaining health information has increased dramatically. Participation in an online health-related social network can enhance patients' self-efficacy and empowerment, as they are given knowledge and tools to manage their chronic health condition more effectively. Thus, we can deduce that patient activation, the extent to which individuals are able to manage their own health care, also increases. However, little is known about the effects of participation in online health-related social networks and patient activation on the perceived usefulness of a website across disease groups. Objective: The intent of the study was to evaluate the effects and benefits of participation in an online health-related social network and to determine which variables predict perceived site usefulness, while examining patient activation. Methods: Data were collected from "Camoni", the first health-related social network in the Hebrew language. It offers medical advice, including blogs, forums, support groups, internal mail, chats, and an opportunity to consult with experts. This study focused on the site's five largest and most active communities: diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, spinal injury, and depression/anxiety. Recruitment was conducted during a three-month period in which a link to the study questionnaire was displayed on the Camoni home page. Three questionnaires were used: a 13-item measure of perceived usefulness (Cronbach alpha=. 93) to estimate the extent to which an individual found the website helpful and informative, a 9-item measure of active involvement in the website (Cronbach alpha=.84), and The Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13, Cronbach alpha=.86), which assesses a patient's level of active participation in his or her health care. Results: There were 296 participants. Men 30-39 years of age scored higher in active involvement than those 40-49 years (P=.03), 50-64 years (P=.004), or 65+ years (P=.01). Respondents 20-29 years of age scored higher in perceived usefulness than those 50-64 years (P=.04) and those 65+ years (P=.049). Those aged 20-29 years scored significantly lower on the PAM-13 scale than those aged 30-39 years (P=.01) and 50-64 years (P=.049). Men and women had similar PAM-13 scores (F-9,F-283=0.17, P=.76). Several variables were significant predictors of perceived usefulness. Age was a negative predictor; younger age was indicative of higher perceived usefulness. Active involvement was a positive predictor. There was a negative relationship found between PAM-13 scores and perceived usefulness, as taking a less active role in one's own medical care predicted higher perceived website usefulness. A trend toward higher frequency of website activity was associated with increased perception of usefulness. Conclusions: Online health-related social networks can be particularly helpful to individuals with lower patient activation. Our findings add information regarding the social and medical importance of such websites, which are gradually becoming an inseparable part of day-to-day chronic disease management in the community.

J	Buchwald, D; Dick, RW				Buchwald, Dedra; Dick, Rhonda Wiegman			Weaving the Native Web: Using Social Network Analysis to Demonstrate the Value of a Minority Career Development Program	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							FACULTY; COLLABORATION; BARRIERS	Purpose American Indian and Alaska Native scientists are consistently among the most underrepresented minority groups in health research. The authors used social network analysis (SNA) to evaluate the Native Investigator Development Program (NIDP), a career development program for junior Native researchers established as a collaboration between the University of Washington and the University of Colorado Denver. Method The study focused on 29 trainees and mentors who participated in the NIDP. Data were collected on manuscripts and grant proposals produced by participants from 1998 to 2007. Information on authorship of manuscripts and collaborations on grant applications was used to conduct social network analyses with three measures of centrality and one measure of network reach. Both visual and quantitative analyses were performed. Results Participants in the NIDP collaborated on 106 manuscripts and 83 grant applications. Although three highly connected individuals, with critical and central roles in the program, accounted for much of the richness of the network, both current core faculty and "graduates" of the program were heavily involved in collaborations on manuscripts and grants. Conclusions This study's innovative application of SNA demonstrates that collaborative relationships can be an important outcome of career development programs for minority investigators and that an analysis of these relationships can provide a more complete assessment of the value of such programs.

J	Han, FF; Ellis, RA				Han, Feifei; Ellis, Robert A.			Configurations of collaborations based on learning orientations amongst medical students	ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article						Student approaches to learning research; Learning orientations; Social network analysis; Configurations of collaboration; Medical students	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; FACE-TO-FACE; ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; HIGHER-EDUCATION; PEER FEEDBACK; ONLINE; PATTERNS; METAANALYSIS; DISCUSSIONS; PERCEPTIONS	While collaboration is an important and key attribute for medical students in order to prepare them to perform well in health care teams, how to effectively develop and assess such skills is challenging. The current widespread practice of using Likert-scale questionnaire only to measure the quantity of collaboration at course and/or program level appears to be insufficient to provide an evidence-base for what counts desirable collaborative learning experience. Drawing on research into student approaches to learning and social network analysis, this study investigates differences in collaborative learning configurations amongst 217 Australian medical students. Based on students' learning orientations (i.e., 'understanding' and 'reproducing') and their choice of collaborations (i.e., whether to collaborate or not, with whom to collaborate, and mode of collaboration), the analyses found five configurations of collaborations differing in a number of features. The most desirable collaborative experience was a configuration of collaborations formed by students with an 'understanding' orientation. This configuration revealed a strong tendency towards intensive pair work with measurable differences in how easy and effectively they collaborated. The results of the study not only have practical implications for teaching and curriculum design for collaborative learning, but also have significant implications for assessing students' collaborative learning experiences.

Physical Activity Trend eXtraction: A Framework for Extracting Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity Trends From Wearable Fitness Tracker Data	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						mHealth; fitness trackers; activity trackers; exercise; health behavior; physical activity; health; mental health; perception; social network	SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR; HEALTH; PREVENTION; PATTERNS; EXERCISE; DISEASE; ADULTS; LIFE	Background: Moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) offers extensive health benefits but is neglected by many. As a result, a wide body of research investigating physical activity behavior change has been conducted. As many of these studies transition from paper-based methods of MVPA data collection to fitness trackers, a series of challenges arise in extracting insights from these new data. Objective: The objective of this research was to develop a framework for preprocessing and extracting MVPA trends from wearable fitness tracker data to support MVPA behavior change studies. Methods: Using heart rate data collected from fitness trackers, we propose Physical Activity Trend eXtraction (PATX), a framework that imputes missing data, recalculates personalized target heart zones, and extracts MVPA trends. We tested our framework on a dataset of 123 college study participants observed across 2 academic years (18 months) using Fitbit Charge HRs. To demonstrate the value of our frameworks' output in supporting MVPA behavior change studies, we applied it to 2 case studies. Results: Among the 123 participants analyzed, PATX labeled 41 participants as experiencing a significant increase in MVPA and 44 participants who experienced a significant decrease in MVPA, with significance defined as P<.05. Our first case study was consistent with previous works investigating the associations between MVPA and mental health. Whereas the second, exploring how individuals perceive their own levels of MVPA relative to their friends, led to a novel observation that individuals were less likely to notice changes in their own MVPA when close ties in their social network mimicked their changes. Conclusions: By providing meaningful and flexible outputs, PATX alleviates data concerns common with fitness trackers to support MVPA behavior change studies as they shift to more objective assessments of MVPA.

Evaluation of a Web-Based Social Network Electronic Game in Enhancing Mental Health Literacy for Young People	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						digital game-based learning; mental health literacy; social networking sites; motivation	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; INTERNET; EDUCATION; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; DISORDERS; COMPUTER; ANXIETY	Background: Internet-based learning programs provide people with massive health care information and self-help guidelines on improving their health. The advent of Web 2.0 and social networks renders significant flexibility to embedding highly interactive components, such as games, to foster learning processes. The effectiveness of game-based learning on social networks has not yet been fully evaluated. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a fully automated, Web-based, social network electronic game on enhancing mental health knowledge and problem-solving skills of young people. We investigated potential motivational constructs directly affecting the learning outcome. Gender differences in learning outcome and motivation were also examined. Methods: A pre/posttest design was used to evaluate the fully automated Web-based intervention. Participants, recruited from a closed online user group, self-assessed their mental health literacy and motivational constructs before and after completing the game within a 3-week period. The electronic game was designed according to cognitive-behavioral approaches. Completers and intent-to-treat analyses, using multiple imputation for missing data, were performed. Regression analysis with backward selection was employed when examining the relationship between knowledge enhancement and motivational constructs. Results: The sample included 73 undergraduates (42 females) for completers analysis. The gaming approach was effective in enhancing young people's mental health literacy (d=0.65). The finding was also consistent with the intent-to-treat analysis, which included 127 undergraduates (75 females). No gender differences were found in learning outcome (P=.97). Intrinsic goal orientation was the primary factor in learning motivation, whereas test anxiety was successfully alleviated in the game setting. No gender differences were found on any learning motivation subscales (P>.10). We also found that participants' self-efficacy for learning and performance, as well as test anxiety, significantly affected their learning outcomes, whereas other motivational subscales were statistically nonsignificant.

J	Hassan, L; Nenadic, G; Tully, MP				Hassan, Lamiece; Nenadic, Goran; Tully, Mary Patricia			A Social Media Campaign (#datasaveslives) to Promote the Benefits of Using Health Data for Research Purposes: Mixed Methods Analysis	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social media; public engagement; social network analysis; medical research	TWITTER; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; COMMUNITY	Background: Social media provides the potential to engage a wide audience about scientific research, including the public. However, little empirical research exists to guide health scientists regarding what works and how to optimize impact. We examined the social media campaign #datasaveslives established in 2014 to highlight positive examples of the use and reuse of health data in research. Objective: This study aims to examine how the #datasaveslives hashtag was used on social media, how often, and by whom; thus, we aim to provide insights into the impact of a major social media campaign in the UK health informatics research community and further afield. Methods: We analyzed all publicly available posts (tweets) that included the hashtag #datasaveslives (N=13,895) on the microblogging platform Twitter between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2017. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses, we determined the frequency and purpose of tweets. Social network analysis was used to analyze and visualize tweet sharing (retweet) networks among hashtag users. Results: Overall, we found 4175 original posts and 9720 retweets featuring #datasaveslives by 3649 unique Twitter users. In total, 66.01% (2756/4175) of the original posts were retweeted at least once. Higher frequencies of tweets were observed during the weeks of prominent policy publications, popular conferences, and public engagement events. Cluster analysis based on retweet relationships revealed an interconnected series of groups of #datasaveslives users in academia, health services and policy, and charities and patient networks. Thematic analysis of tweets showed that #datasaveslives was used for a broader range of purposes than indexing information, including event reporting, encouraging participation and action, and showing personal support for data sharing. Conclusions: This study shows that a hashtag-based social media campaign was effective in encouraging a wide audience of stakeholders to disseminate positive examples of health research. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the campaign supported community building and bridging practices within and between the interdisciplinary sectors related to the field of health data science and encouraged individuals to demonstrate personal support for sharing health data.

Factors associated with post-acute discharge location after hospital stay: a cross-sectional study from a Swiss hospital	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Subacute care; Diagnosis-related groups; Acute and transitional care; Switzerland	ACUTE TRANSITION; SOCIAL NETWORKS; CARE; SCALE	BackgroundIn 2012, Switzerland introduced the diagnosis-related group hospital payment system. Fearing that vulnerable patients may be discharged early, Acute and Transitional Care (ATC) was introduced to address the nursing care of patients who no longer needed an acute hospital stay. ATC is more costly for patients when compared to other discharge options like rehabilitation while providing less rehabilitative services. This study investigates factors associated with the place of discharge for patients in need of care.MethodsData was collected from 660 medical records of inpatients 50years and older of the municipal hospital Triemli in Zurich, Switzerland. We used stepwise logistic regression to identify factors associated with their discharge into ATC or rehabilitation.ResultsOlder patients with higher Delirium Observation Scale (DOS), lack of supplementary health insurance, resuscitation order and a lower social network were more likely to be discharged into ATC than rehabilitation.ConclusionsThe association of supplementary health insurance and social network with discharge into ATC or rehabilitation is problematic because patients that are already vulnerable from a financial and social perspective are potentially discharged into a more costly and less rehabilitative post-acute care facility.

Using social network analysis to examine the decision-making process on new vaccine introduction in Nigeria	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Policy analysis; vaccine policy; social network analysis; new vaccine introduction; developing country; Hib vaccine; pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; rotavirus vaccine	STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; POLICY NETWORKS; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; PREVALENCE; ACCELERATE; EXPERIENCE	The decision-making process to introduce new vaccines into national immunization programmes is often complex, involving many stakeholders who provide technical information, mobilize finance, implement programmes and garner political support. Stakeholders may have different levels of interest, knowledge and motivations to introduce new vaccines. Lack of consensus on the priority, public health value or feasibility of adding a new vaccine can delay policy decisions. Efforts to support country-level decision-making have largely focused on establishing global policies and equipping policy makers with the information to support decision-making on new vaccine introduction (NVI). Less attention has been given to understanding the interactions of policy actors and how the distribution of influence affects the policy process and decision-making. Social network analysis (SNA) is a social science technique concerned with explaining social phenomena using the structural and relational features of the network of actors involved. This approach can be used to identify how information is exchanged and who is included or excluded from the process. For this SNA of vaccine decision-making in Nigeria, we interviewed federal and state-level government officials, officers of bilateral and multilateral partner organizations, and other stakeholders such as health providers and the media. Using data culled from those interviews, we performed an SNA in order to map formal and informal relationships and the distribution of influence among vaccine decision-makers, as well as to explore linkages and pathways to stakeholders who can influence critical decisions in the policy process. Our findings indicate a relatively robust engagement of key stakeholders in Nigeria. We hypothesized that economic stakeholders and implementers would be important to ensure sustainable financing and strengthen programme implementation, but some economic and implementation stakeholders did not appear centrally on the map; this may suggest a need to strengthen the decision-making processes by engaging these stakeholders more centrally and earlier.

This study describes the characteristics and relationships (along with the variables predicting their degree of interorganisational collaboration) of 68 organisations of such a network in Montreal (Quebec, Canada). Theory and methods: Data were collected primarily through a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive analyses were conducted followed by social network and multivariate analyses. Results: The Montreal homeless network has a high density (50.5%) and a decentralised structure and maintains a mostly informal collaboration with the public and cross-sectorial sectors. The network density showed more frequent contacts among four types of organisations which could point to the existence of cliques. Four variables predicted interorganisational collaboration: organisation type, number of services offered, volume of referrals and satisfaction with the relationships with public organisations. Conclusions and discussion: The Montreal homeless network seems adequate to address non-complex homelessness problems. Considering, however, that most homeless individuals present chronic and complex profiles, it appears necessary to have a more formal and better integrated network of homeless organisations, particularly in the health and social service sectors, in order to improve services.

COVID-19 and the "Film Your Hospital" Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis of Twitter Data	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						COVID-19; coronavirus; Twitter; misinformation; fake news; social network analysis; public health; social media		Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of conspiracy theories have emerged. A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are "empty." Research has shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice about social distancing and other public health interventions. Due to the possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an understanding of the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it. Objective: This study set out to evaluate the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which online sources of information were used as evidence to support the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a conspiracy theory in the future. Methods: Twitter data related to the #FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify accounts with a higher probability of being bots. Results: The most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on the platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and deleted accounts within the network. Conclusions: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can be targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing misinformation. Social media organizations need to bolster their efforts to label or remove content that contains misinformation. Public health authorities could enlist the assistance of influencers in spreading antinarrative content.

These specific networks do offer lots of options as well as plenty of advantages and disadvantages. The social websites are many in number and titles, such as the facebook, the twitter, the bandoo etc. One of the most important function-mechanisms for the social network websites, are the marketing tools. The future goal is suggested to be the evolution of these programs.

But unlike transient conditions like flu, social media users are less vocal about chronic conditions such as obesity, as users might not tweet "I'm still overweight". As, however, obesity-related conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis, and even cancer are on the rise, this obese-or-not label could be one of the most useful for studies in public health. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using profile pictures to infer if a user is overweight or not. We show that this is indeed possible and further show that the fraction of labeled-as-overweight users is higher in U.S. counties with higher obesity rates. Going from public to individual health analysis, we then find differences both in behavior and social networks, for example finding users labeled as overweight to have fewer followers.

This study explores the potential of online social networking as an avenue for peer support. Using a cross sectional survey, 74 secondary students answered questions relating to internet use, online social network use and perceptions of mental health support. Over half of the sample had experienced a need for mental health support with 53% of participants turning to the internet. Results indicate that online social networking sites were used regularly by 82% of the sample and 47% believed these sites could help with mental health problems. The study concluded that online social networking sites may be able to link young people together with others in similar situations. The popularity and frequency of use may allow these sites to provide information, advice and direction for those seeking help.

Objective: This study aimed to propose a conceptual data-driven framework that tracks digital markers of public organ donation awareness using Twitter and delivers an optimized social network intervention (SNI) to targeted audiences using Facebook. Methods: We monitored digital markers of organ donation awareness across the United States over a 1-year period using Twitter and examined their association with organ donation registration. We delivered this SNI on Facebook with and without optimized awareness content (ie, educational content with a weblink to an online donor registration website) to low-income Hispanics in Los Angeles over a 1-month period and measured the daily number of impressions (ie, exposure to information) and clicks (ie, engagement) among the target audience. Results: Digital markers of organ donation awareness on Twitter are associated with donation registration (beta=.0032; P <.001) such that 10 additional organ-related tweets are associated with a 3.20% (33,933/1,060,403) increase in the number of organ donor registrations at the city level. In addition, our SNI on Facebook effectively reached 1 million users, and the use of optimization significantly increased the rate of clicks per impression (beta=.0213; P<.004). Conclusions: Our framework can provide a real-time characterization of organ donation awareness while effectively delivering tailored interventions to minority communities. It can complement past approaches to create large-scale, sustainable interventions that are capable of raising awareness and effectively mitigate disparities in organ donation.

Seeking Support on Facebook: A Content Analysis of Breast Cancer Groups	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Internet; Facebook; breast cancer; supportive care; peer support; health promotion; fundraising	ONLINE COMMUNITIES; WOMEN; INFORMATION; ADOLESCENT; MYSPACE; IMPACT; SITES; NEEDS	Background: Social network sites have been growing in popularity across broad segments of Internet users, and are a convenient means to exchange information and support. Research on their use for health-related purposes is limited. Objective: This study aimed to characterize the purpose, use, and creators of Facebook groups related to breast cancer. Methods: We searched Facebook (www.Facebook.com) using the term breast cancer. We restricted our analysis to groups that were related to breast cancer, operated in English, and were publicly available. Two of us independently extracted information on the administrator and purpose of the group, as well as the number of user-generated contributions. We developed a coding scheme to guide content analysis. Results: We found 620 breast cancer groups on Facebook containing a total of 1,090,397 members. The groups were created for fundraising (277/620, 44.7%), awareness (236, 38.1%), product or service promotion related to fundraising or awareness (61, 9%), or patient/caregiver support (46, 7%). The awareness groups as a whole contained by far the most members (n = 957,289). The majority of groups (532, 85.8%) had 25 wall posts or fewer. The support oriented groups, 47% (27/57) of which were established by high school or college students, were associated with the greatest number of user-generated contributions. Conclusions: Facebook groups have become a popular tool for awareness-raising, fundraising, and support-seeking related to breast cancer attracting over one million users. Given their popularity and reach, further research is warranted to explore the implications of social network sites as a health resource across various health conditions, cultures, ages, and socioeconomic groups.

Methods Through text mining and sentiment analysis of users' online interactions, the research revealed sentiment dynamics in threaded discussions. A novel metric-the number of influential responding replies-was proposed to directly measure a user's ability to affect the sentiment of others. Results Using the dataset from a popular OHC, the research demonstrated that the proposed metric is highly effective in identifying influential users. In addition, combining the metric with other traditional measures further improves the identification of influential users.

The impact of social networks on knowledge transfer in long-term care facilities: Protocol for a study	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							RESIDENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT; ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; P-ASTERISK MODELS; NO MAGIC BULLETS; OPINION LEADERS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; MISSING DATA; QUALITY; HEALTH; DIFFUSION	Background: Social networks are theorized as significant influences in the innovation adoption and behavior change processes. Our understanding of how social networks operate within healthcare settings is limited. As a result, our ability to design optimal interventions that employ social networks as a method of fostering planned behavior change is also limited. Through this proposed project, we expect to contribute new knowledge about factors influencing uptake of knowledge translation interventions. Objectives: Our specific aims include: To collect social network data among staff in two long-term care (LTC) facilities; to characterize social networks in these units; and to describe how social networks influence uptake and use of feedback reports. Methods and design: In this prospective study, we will collect data on social networks in nursing units in two LTC facilities, and use social network analysis techniques to characterize and describe the networks. These data will be combined with data from a funded project to explore the impact of social networks on uptake and use of feedback reports. In this parent study, feedback reports using standardized resident assessment data are distributed on a monthly basis. Surveys are administered to assess report uptake. In the proposed project, we will collect data on social networks, analyzing the data using graphical and quantitative techniques. We will combine the social network data with survey data to assess the influence of social networks on uptake of feedback reports. Discussion: This study will contribute to understanding mechanisms for knowledge sharing among staff on units to permit more efficient and effective intervention design. A growing number of studies in the social network literature suggest that social networks can be studied not only as influences on knowledge translation, but also as possible mechanisms for fostering knowledge translation. This study will contribute to building theory to design such interventions.

This study examined the effectiveness of a program put in place by BJC HealthCare, a hospital system based in St. Louis, Missouri, that tied employees' eligibility to participate in the system's most generous health plan with participation in a wellness program. The intervention, which began in 2005, was associated with a 41 percent decrease, relative to a comparison group, in hospitalizations for conditions targeted by the wellness program but with no significant decrease in other hospitalizations. We found reductions in inpatient costs but similar increases in non-inpatient costs. Therefore, we conclude that although the program did cut some hospitalizations, it did not save money for the employer in the short term. This finding underscores that wellness program incentives under the Affordable Care Act are unlikely to greatly reduce health care spending over the short run.

However, information reliability in these forums is unfortunately not always guaranteed. Obviously, consequences of self-diagnosis may be severe on the patient's health if measures are taken without consulting a doctor. Many works on trust issues related to social media have been proposed, but most of them mainly focus only on the structure part of the social network (number of posts, number of likes, etc.). In the case of online health forums, a lot of trust and distrust is expressed inside the posted messages and cannot be inferred by only considering the structure. In this study, we rather suggest inferring the user's trustworthiness from the replies he receives in the forum. The proposed method is divided into three main steps: First, the recipient(s) of each post must be identified. Next, the trust or distrust expressed in these posts is evaluated. Finally, the user's reputation is computed by aggregating all the posts he received. Conducted experiments using a manually annotated corpus are encouraging.

Care managers are often involved in chronic disease management and associated transitional care. In this study, we examined the communication regarding chronic disease care within 24 primary care practices in Michigan and Colorado. We sought to answer the following questions: Do care managers play a key role in chronic disease management in the practice? Does the prominence of the care manager's connectivity within the practice's communicatihe type of care management structure implemented? Individual written surveys were given to all practice members in the participating practices. Survey questions assessed demographics as well as practice culture, quality improvement, care management activities, and communication regarding chronic disease care. Using social network analysis and other statistical methods, we analyzed the communication dynamics related to chronic disease care for each practice. The structure of chronic disease communication varies greatly from ly to be in the core of the communication network than were off-site care managers. Thpractice to practice. Care managers who were embedded in the practice or co-located were more likeese care managers also had higher in-degree centrality, indicating that they acted as a hub for communication with team members in many other roles. Social network analysis provided a useful means of examining chronic disease communication in practice, and highlighted the central role of care managers in this communication when their role structure supported such communication. Structuring care managers as embedded team members within the practice has important implications for their role in chronic disease communication within primary care.

Reach of Messages in a Dental Twitter Network: Cohort Study Examining User Popularity, Communication Pattern, and Network Structure	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social media; health communication; dentists; students; dental; social network analysis; twitter; social networks	SOCIAL MEDIA; PUBLIC-HEALTH; DIFFUSION	Background: Increasing the reach of messages disseminated through Twitter promotes the success of Twitter-based health education campaigns. Objective: This study aimed to identify factors associated with reach in a dental Twitter network (1) initially and (2) sustainably at individual and network levels. Methods: We used instructors' and students' Twitter usernames from a Saudi dental school in 2016-2017 and applied Gephi (a social network analysis tool) and social media analytics to calculate user and network metrics. Content analysis was performed to identify users disseminating oral health information. The study outcomes were reach at baseline and sustainably over 1.5 years. The explanatory variables were indicators of popularity (number of followers, likes, tweets retweeted by others), communication pattern (number of tweets, retweets, replies, tweeting/ retweeting oral health information or not). Multiple logistic regression models were used to investigate associations. Results: Among dental users, 31.8% had reach at baseline and 62.9% at the end of the study, reaching a total of 749,923 and dropping to 37,169 users at the end. At an individual level, reach was associated with the number of followers (baseline: odds ratio, OR=1.003, 95% CI=1.001-1.005 and sustainability: OR=1.002, 95% CI=1.0001-1.003), likes (baseline: OR=1.001, 95% CI=1.0001-1.002 and sustainability: OR=1.0031, 95% CI=1.0003-1.002), and replies (baseline: OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.005-1.04 and sustainability: OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.004-1.03). At the network level, users with the least followers, tweets, retweets, and replies had the greatest reach. Conclusions: Reach was reduced by time. Factors increasing reach at the user level had different impact at the network level. More than one strategy is needed to maximize reach.

Predicting Peer Nominations Among Medical Students: A Social Network Approach	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							SPECIALTY INTEREST; PERSONALITY; PROFESSIONALISM; COMPETENCE; GENDER; CAREER; CHOICE; HEALTH	Purpose Minimal attention has been paid to what factors may predict peer nomination or how peer nominations might exhibit a clustering effect. Focusing on the homophily principle that "birds of a feather flock together," and using a social network analysis approach, the authors investigated how certain student-and/or school-based factors might predict the likelihood of peer nomination, and the clusters, if any, that occur among those nominations. Method In 2013, the Jefferson Longitudinal Study of Medical Education included a special instrument to evaluate peer nominations. A total of 211 (81%) of 260 graduating medical students from the Sidney Kimmel Medical College responded to the peer nomination question. Data were analyzed using a relational contingency table and an ANOVA density model. Results Although peer nominations did not cluster around gender, age, or class rank, those students within an accelerated program, as well as those entering certain specialties, were more likely to nominate each other. The authors suggest that clerkships in certain specialties, as well as the accelerated program, may provide structured opportunities for students to connect and integrate, and that these opportunities may have an impact on peer nomination. The findings suggest that social network analysis is a useful approach to examine various aspects of peer nomination processes. Conclusions The authors discuss implications regarding harnessing social cohesion within clinical clerkships, the possible development of siloed departmental identity and in-group favoritism, and future research possibilities.

J	Nimmon, L; Regehr, G				Nimmon, Laura; Regehr, Glenn			The Complexity of Patients' Health Communication Social Networks: A Broadening of Physician Communication	TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE			English	Article						ethnography; qualitative research; physician-patient communication; social network analysis	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; SKILLS; CARE; COMPETENCE; CONTEXT; SCIENCE; POWER	Phenomenon: Patients have access to a wide variety of sources of information about their health in their day-to-day contexts. This can sometimes result in discordance between a physician's perception of a patient's health issue and a patient's perception of their health issue. Even after the physician has negotiated an understanding and treatment plan with a patient, subsequent interactions outside the physician-patient encounter may modify the patient's understanding of their health issue. A patient's reinterpretation of his or her health issue can then result in nonadherence of the treatment plan or even alternative treatment plans that the physician perceives as being unsatisfactory. Current models of physician-patient communication do not prepare physicians to manage this phenomenon. Approach: Using an ethnographic and a social network analysis research design, participants' patterns of social interaction around health information were investigated over a yearlong period (2012-2013) in a small rural community in Western Canada. Data included (a) individual interviews, (b) focus group interviews, and (c) field notes. Data were analyzed in a three-stage process: (a) item analysis, (b) pattern analysis, and (c) structural analysis. Findings: The findings highlight how physicians are only one nodal point in patients' broad, multilayered networks of communication. Interactions around health topics were not isolated events but rather occurred in various patterns of social interactions that were longitudinal and iterative. Meaning making around health topics was constructed, shared, elaborated, reconstructed, and interpreted in participants' social networks, as information was distributed through a complex temporal system of interpersonal ties. Insights: Issues concerning physician communication have been a long-standing conversation in the field of medical education. Many competency frameworks have attempted to encompass this core competency in their elaboration of the physician communicator. However, most representations and discussions in the field tend to depict physician communicators as experts who translate their knowledge to patients in a simplified way, in a single moment in time. This study suggests that educational initiatives in physician-patient communication would benefit from contextualizing physicians as part of patients' resource-rich, temporally extended, iterative process of meaning making. This alternative framing has the potential to support physicians' continuing engagement with patients as a meaningful and responsive node in patients' meaning-making networks.

A Qualitative Investigation of Factors that Influence School Employee Health Behaviors: Implications for Wellness Programming	JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH			English	Article						child & adolescent health; employee health promotion; nutrition & diet; physical fitness & sport; program planning; school employees		BACKGROUND Employee health promotion in the elementary school setting can support students' health and academic success. School employees can serve as role models, yet evidence suggests poor health in this population. We identified factors that influence school employee health behaviors to inform subsequent development of employee wellness programs. METHODS Focus groups (10 groups, total N = 62) and interviews (N = 5) were conducted with school employees. Participants were recruited from schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged, racially diverse districts in Massachusetts. We used a socioecological framework to identify multi-level factors that influence employee health behaviors. Factors were characterized as supports (+) or barriers (-) to health-promoting behaviors. RESULTS Eight themes highlighted the importance of an organizational culture that sustains successful employee wellness programming. Intrapersonal themes included: High Stress (+/-), Desire to Adopt Healthy Behaviors (+), and Sufficient Health Knowledge (+). Interpersonal themes included: Strong Social Network (+) and a Desire to Role Model (+). Organizational themes included: Demanding Job (-), Lack of Wellness Culture (-), and Unhealthy Food (-). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that this population would be receptive to wellness programming.

This paper introduces a technological solution, "OB CITY" that supports the management of childhood obesity. The system mainly uses the behavior treatment, providing two types of user terminal for the parents and the children, through an establishment of a children's social network game, letting parents grow children with a scientific way, and letting children have good living habits and learn the relevant knowledge in the game, and get a normal value of BMI. The system is in a definition phase, and will be validated with user interaction experts, leading to a first mockup to be tested with end-users.

These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. Methods: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the #5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. Results: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. Conclusions: The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.

The situational factors that young people report as impacting their well-being are not addressed as often: specifically, family discord. Kids Helpline, a national service in Australia that provides free counseling online and by telephone to young people in distress, report that family discord and well-being issues are one of the major concerns reported by clients. In order to meet the preferences that young people seek when accessing counseling support, Kids Helpline has designed and trialed a custom-built social network platform for group counseling of young people experiencing family discord that impacts their well-being. Objective: In this exploratory study, we communicate the findings of Phase 1 of an innovative study in user and online counselor experience. This will lead to an iterative design for a world-first, purpose-built social network that will do the following: (1) increase reach and quality of service by utilizing a digital tool of preference for youth to receive peer-to-peer and counselor-to-peer support in a safe online environment and (2) provide the evidence base to document the best practice for online group counseling in a social network environment. Methods: The study utilized a participatory action research design. Young people aged 13-25 years (N=105) with mild-to-moderate depression or anxiety (not high risk) who contacted Kids Helpline were asked if they would like to trial the social networking site (SNS) for peer-to-peer and counselor-to-peer group support. Subjects were grouped into age cohorts of no more than one year above or below their reported age and assigned to groups of no more than 36 participants, in order to create a community of familiarity around age and problems experienced. Each group entered into an 8-week group counseling support program guided by counselors making regular posts and providing topic-specific content for psychoeducation and discussion. Counselors provided a weekly log of events to researchers; at 2-week intervals, subjects provided qualitative and quantitative feedback through open-ended questions and specific psychometric measures. Results: Qualitative results provided evidence of user support and benefits of the online group counseling environment. Counselors also reported benefits of the modality of therapy delivery. Psychometric scales did not report significance in changes of mood or affect. Counselors and users suggested improvements to the platform to increase user engagement. Conclusions: Phase 1 provided proof of concept for this mode of online counseling delivery. Users and counselors saw value in the model and innovation of the service. Phase 2 will address platform issues with changes to a new social network platform.

J	Martinsen, DS; Schrama, R				Martinsen, Dorte Sindbjerg; Schrama, Reini			Networked Health Care Governance in the European Union	JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article						health care governance; European administrative networks; cross-border health care; pharmacovigilance	EU; PHARMACOVIGILANCE	The European Union (EU) increasingly resorts to new forms of governance to establish unified health and welfare policies without member states having to transfer their sovereignty to a supranational level. European Administrative Networks are important instruments in the toolbox of new forms of governance, dealing with rulemaking, rule monitoring, and rule enforcement. Operating beyond, but not above, the state, European networks of national administrative units allow for interaction and exchange to coordinate national responses to increased interaction across their borders. The authors use social network analysis to uncover the pattern of interaction among national representatives in two central EU health care networks. Their analysis finds not only that the network in the area of pharmacovigilance has more competences, resources, and capacity to improve the enforcement of EU rules than the network regarding cross-border health care but also that the driving forces behind network interaction appear to differ quite a bit as well. While the supranational character becomes apparent in the former network, network interactions in the latter seem aimed at mitigating the impact of patient mobility rather than improving cross-border health care take up.

Using Add Health data on secondary schools in the U.S., we investigate whether these effects partly flow through the eating habits channel. Adolescents are assumed to interact through a friendship social network. We propose a two-equation model. The first equation provides a social interaction model of fast food consumption. To estimate this equation we use a quasi maximum likelihood approach that allows us to control for common environment at the network level and to solve the simultaneity (reflection) problem. Our second equation is a panel dynamic weight production function relating an individual's Body Mass Index z-score (zBMI) to his fast food consumption and his lagged zBMI, and allowing for irregular intervals in the data. Results show that there are positive but small peer effects in fast food consumption among adolescents belonging to a same friendship school network. Based on our preferred specification, the estimated social multiplier is 1.15. Our results also suggest that, in the long run, an extra day of weekly fast food restaurant visits increases zBMI by 4.45% when ignoring peer effects and by 5.11%, when they are taken into account.

J	Vu, D; Lomi, A; Mascia, D; Pallotti, F				Duy Vu; Lomi, Alessandro; Mascia, Daniele; Pallotti, Francesca			Relational event models for longitudinal network data with an application to interhospital patient transfers	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						social network analysis; relational event models; interorganizational relations; interhospital patient transfers	SOCIAL NETWORK; REGRESSION; SELECTION; DYNAMICS; COMMUNITY; SYSTEMS; HEALTH; CARE	The main objective of this paper is to introduce and illustrate relational event models, a new class of statistical models for the analysis of time-stamped data with complex temporal and relational dependencies. We outline the main differences between recently proposed relational event models and more conventional network models based on the graph-theoretic formalism typically adopted in empirical studies of social networks. Our main contribution involves the definition and implementation of a marked point process extension of currently available models. According to this approach, the sequence of events of interest is decomposed into two components: (a) event time and (b) event destination. This decomposition transforms the problem of selection of event destination in relational event models into a conditional multinomial logistic regression problem. The main advantages of this formulation are the possibility of controlling for the effect of event-specific data and a significant reduction in the estimation time of currently available relational event models. We demonstrate the empirical value of the model in an analysis of interhospital patient transfers within a regional community of health care organizations. We conclude with a discussion of how the models we presented help to overcome some the limitations of statistical models for networks that are currently available.

J	Mascia, D; Dandi, R; Di Vincenzo, F				Mascia, Daniele; Dandi, Roberto; Di Vincenzo, Fausto			Professional networks and EBM use: A study of inter-physician interaction across levels of care	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Evidence-based medicine; Social network analysis; Italy; Organizational theory; Social contagion; Influence	EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE; PRACTICE GUIDELINES; CENTRALITY MEASURES; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; SOCIAL NETWORKS; HEALTH; KNOWLEDGE; PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; IMPACT	Physicians around the globe are increasingly encouraged to adopt guidelines, protocols and other scientific material when making clinical decisions. Extant research suggests that the clinicians' propensity to use evidence-based medicine (EBM) is strongly associated with the professional collaborative networks they establish and maintain with peers. In this paper we explore whether and how the connectedness of primary care physicians with colleagues working in hospital settings is related to their frequency of EBM use in clinical practice. We used survey data from 104 pediatricians working in five local health authorities in the Italian NHS. Social network and attributional data concerning single physicians, as well as their self-reported frequency of EBM use, were collected for three major pathologies in pediatric care: asthmatic, gastro-enteric and urinary pathologies. Ordered regression analysis was employed. Our findings documented a positive association between the number of physicians' relationships with hospital colleagues and the frequency of use EBM. Results also indicated that physicians' organizational affiliations influence the frequency of EBM use. Finally, contrary to our expectations, it was found that clinicians' affiliation to formal collaborative arrangements is at odds with the likelihood of reporting higher frequency of EBM use.

On the other hand, CME programs that encourage interactivity between participants may impact structures and behaviors in these professional associations. With the advent of information and communication technologies, new communication spaces have emerged that have the potential to enhance networked learning in national and international professional associations and increase the effectiveness of CME for health professionals. In this article, network science, based on the application of network theory and other theories, is proposed as an approach to better understand the contribution networking and interactivity between health professionals in professional communities make to their learning and adoption of new practices over time.

J	Pagkalos, I; Petrou, L				Pagkalos, Ioannis; Petrou, Loukas			SENHANCE: A Semantic Web framework for integrating social and hardware sensors in e-Health	HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL			English	Article						e-Health; lifestyle monitoring; Semantic Web; social networks; social sensor	REPRODUCIBILITY; ONTOLOGIES; VALIDITY	Self-reported data are very important in Healthcare, especially when combined with data from sensors. Social Networking Sites, such as Facebook, are a promising source of not only self-reported data but also social data, which are otherwise difficult to obtain. Due to their unstructured nature, providing information that is meaningful to health professionals from this source is a daunting task. To this end, we employ Social Network Applications as Social Sensors that gather structured data and use Semantic Web technologies to fuse them with hardware sensor data, effectively integrating both sources. We show that this combination of social and hardware sensor observations creates a novel space that can be used for a variety of feature-rich e-Health applications. We present the design of our prototype framework, SENHANCE, and our findings from its pilot application in the NutriHeAl project, where a Facebook app is integrated with Fitbit digital pedometers for Lifestyle monitoring.

Integral to this are interprofessional education service-learning initiatives attendant to socially accountable objectives. We describe one such initiative, the Zanempilo Mobile Health Education Platform (MHEP), which engages interprofessional healthcare students and faculty members in delivering health services to underserved communities. The Zanempilo MHEP consists of a converted 13-ton truck as a mobile clinic from where student-run services are provided. We illustrate the intentional process by which we, an interprofessional health science working group, created socially accountable learning goals appropriate to the above platform. We developed, employed, and refined a process-oriented-participatory approach rooted in theories of social constructivism and social network development that included the following phases: orientation, analysis, synthesis, production, and dissemination. Out of this approach emerged several socially accountable learning goals for students and faculty members working on the Zanempilo MHEP. These goals incorporated five educational domains, namely knowledge, attitudes, skills, intentions, and relationships. We anticipate using these goals to identify future curricular objectives and competencies.

Exposure, hazard, and survival analysis of diffusion on social networks	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						competing risks; diffusion of innovations; social network	THRESHOLD MODELS; COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR; INTERFERENCE; INNOVATIONS; CONTAGION; TRIAL	Sociologists, economists, epidemiologists, and others recognize the importance of social networks in the diffusion of ideas and behaviors through human societies. To measure the flow of information on real-world networks, researchers often conduct comprehensive sociometric mapping of social links between individuals and then follow the spread of an innovation from reports of adoption or change in behavior over time. The innovation is introduced to a small number of individuals who may also be encouraged to spread it to their network contacts. In conjunction with the known social network, the pattern of adoptions gives researchers insight into the spread of the innovation in the population and factors associated with successful diffusion. Researchers have used widely varying statistical tools to estimate these quantities, and there is disagreement about how to analyze diffusion on fully observed networks. Here, we describe a framework for measuring features of diffusion processes on social networks using the epidemiological concepts of exposure and competing risks. Given a realization of a diffusion process on a fully observed network, we show that classical survival regression models can be adapted to estimate the rate of diffusion, and actor/edge attributes associated with successful transmission or adoption, while accounting for the topology of the social network. We illustrate these tools by applying them to a randomized network intervention trial conducted in Honduras to estimate the rate of adoption of 2 health-related interventionsmultivitamins and chlorine bleach for water purificationand determine factors associated with successful social transmission.

Understanding views on everyday use of personal health information: Insights from community dwelling older adults	INFORMATICS FOR HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE			English	Article						Healthy aging; older adults; personal health information management; stakeholder engagement; wellness	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; AGING IN-PLACE; INVISIBLE WORK; SYSTEM MODEL; MANAGEMENT; HOME; SUPPORT; ENVIRONMENT; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE	Background: Older adults apply various strategies to pursue healthy aging, but we know little about their views and use of personal health information to accomplish those ends. Methods: As a first step in formulating the role of personal health information management (PHIM) in healthy aging, we explored the perspectives of older adults on health and health information used in their everyday lives through four focus groups with 25 community-dwelling adults aged 60 and over. Results: We found that the concept of wellness-the holistic and multidimensional nature of health and wellbeing-plays prominently in how older adults think about health and health information. Participants expressed wellness from a position of personal strength, rather than health-related deficits, by focusing on wellness activities for staying healthy through: (1) personal health practices, (2) social network support, and (3) residential community engagement. Conclusion: Although these themes involve personal health information, existing PHIM systems that focus on disease management are generally not designed to support wellness activities. Substantial opportunity exists to fill this wellness support gap with innovative health information technology designed for older adults. Findings carry implications for the design of PHIM tools that support healthy aging and methods for engaging older adults as co-producers of this critical support.	[Hartzler, A.

Our study aims at exploring patient referral networks in two rural districts in Tanzania, Kilolo and Msalala. Firstly, we ask whether secondary-level facilities act as gatekeepers, mediating referrals from primary- to tertiary-level facilities. Secondly, we explore the facility and network-level determinants of patient referrals focusing on treatment of childhood illnesses and non-communicable diseases. We use data collected across all public health facilities in the districts in 2018. To study gate-keeping, we employ descriptive network analysis tools. To explore the determinants of referrals, we use exponential random graph models. In Kilolo, we find a disproportionate share of patients referred directly to the largest hospital due to geographical proximity. In Msalala, small and specialized secondary-level facilities seem to attract more patients. Overall, the results call for policies to increase referrals to secondary facilities avoiding expensive referrals to hospitals, improving timeliness of care and reducing travel-related financial burden for households.

J	Malin, B; Nyemba, S; Paulett, J				Malin, Bradley; Nyemba, Steve; Paulett, John			Learning relational policies from electronic health record access logs	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electronic health records; Organizational behavior; Knowledge discovery; Access logs; Auditing	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; WEB; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; USAGE; MANAGEMENT; SUPPORT	Modern healthcare organizations (HCOs) are composed of complex dynamic teams to ensure clinical operations are executed in a quick and competent manner. At the same time, the fluid nature of such environments hinders administrators' efforts to define access control policies that appropriately balance patient privacy and healthcare functions. Manual efforts to define these policies are labor-intensive and error-prone, often resulting in systems that endow certain care providers with overly broad access to patients' medical records while restricting other providers from legitimate and timely use. In this work, we propose an alternative method to generate these policies by automatically mining usage patterns from electronic health record (EHR) systems. EHR systems are increasingly being integrated into clinical environments and our approach is designed to be generalizable across HCOs, thus assisting in the design and evaluation of local access control policies. Our technique, which is grounded in data mining and social network analysis theory, extracts a statistical model of the organization from the access logs of its EHRs. In doing so, our approach enables the review of predefined policies, as well as the discovery of unknown behaviors. We evaluate our approach with 5 months of access logs from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and confirm the existence of stable social structures and intuitive business operations. Additionally, we demonstrate that there is significant turnover in the interactions between users in the HCO and that policies learned at the department-level afford greater stability over time.

The structure of formal and informal social networks can influence, and be influenced, by the implementation of EIDM interventions. Methods: In a mixed methods study we assessed the outcomes of a targeted training intervention to promote EIDM among the staff in three public health units in Ontario, Canada. This report focuses on the qualitative phase of the study in which key staff were interviewed about the process of engagement in the intervention, communications during the intervention, and social consequences. Results: Senior managers identified staff to take part in the intervention. Engagement was a top-down process determined by the way organizational leaders promoted EIDM and the relevance of staff's jobs to EIDM. Communication among staff participating in the workshops and ongoing progress meetings was influential in overcoming personal and normative barriers to implementing EIDM, and promoted the formation of long-lasting social connections among staff. Organization-wide presentations and meetings facilitated the recognition of expertise that the trained staff gained, including their reputation as experts according to their peers in different divisions. Conclusion: Selective training and capacity development interventions can result in forming an elite versus ordinary pattern that facilitates the recognition of in-house qualified experts while also strengthening social status inequality. The role of leadership in public health units is pivotal in championing and overseeing the implementation process. Network analysis can guide and inform the design, process, and evaluation of the EIDM training interventions.

There are limited data on the association between social isolation and physical function including gait speed. Hence, this study is to determine the prevalence of social isolation and its association with gait speed, frailty, cognition, depression and comorbidities amongst community-dwelling older adults. Methods Social isolation, depression, frailty and perceived general health were assessed using 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), FRAIL scale and EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire which includes EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), respectively. Cognition was assessed using the Chinese Mini Mental State Examination (cMMSE), while physical performance test included gait speed and short physical performance battery test. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine the influence of socio-demographic, medical, functional and cognitive variables on social isolation. Results Out of 202 participants, 27.7% were robust, 66.8% of participants were pre-frail, and 5.4% of participants were frail. Almost half (45.5%, n = 92) of the participants were found to be at risk of social isolation. A poor social network was negatively associated with mean gait speed (OR = 0.674, CI 0.464-0.979, p = 0.039), EQ-VAS (OR = 0.561, CI 0.390-0.806, p < 0.01) and cMMSE (OR = 0.630, 95% CI 0.413-0.960, p = 0.032). Conclusion Almost half of older adults in the community are at risk of social isolation with a very significant association with gait speed, cMMSE and EQ-VAS scores.

Using electronic health record data and social network analysis, the network of healthcare professionals involved in colorectal cancer care at a large, urban academic medical center were mapped and studied. A total of 100 surgical colorectal cancer patients receiving treatment in 2013 and 2014 were selected at random. We used detailed access logs for the EHR to map the network of all healthcare professionals for each patient, including inpatient and outpatient settings. Approximately 2.45 million records of access logs from more than 6,800 unique users, representing over 150 roles or occupations were analyzed. Across all networks, professionals were connected to an average of 5.8 other professionals, but some were rarely connected with others while over 20 were very highly connected (> 100 other professionals). Housestaff, attending physicians, and nurses played central roles in the global network with a high number of inter- and intra-professional connections. Clusters of professionals with frequent interaction were demonstrated but, based on the size and complexity of the network, serendipitous interactions were unlikely. Settings for care seemed to influence these clusters. Patient-centric care networks were similar to the global network with some potentially important differences. Access-log information from electronic health records can be an important source of information about relationships between healthcare professionals. Findings from analyses such as this one may help define the state of current networks and potential targets for interventions to improve the quality of care.

J	Xu, R; Cavallo, D				Xu, Ran; Cavallo, David			Social Network Analysis of the Effects of a Social Media-Based Weight Loss Intervention Targeting Adults of Low Socioeconomic Status: Single-Arm Intervention Trial	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						weight loss intervention; social media intervention; electronic health; social network analysis		Background: Obesity is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease risk factors, including hypertension and type II diabetes. Although numerous weight loss interventions have demonstrated efficacy, there is considerably less evidence about the theoretical mechanisms through which they work. Delivering lifestyle behavior change interventions via social media provides unique opportunities for understanding mechanisms of intervention effects. Server data collected directly from web-based platforms can provide detailed, real-time behavioral information over the course of intervention programs that can be used to understand how interventions work. Objective: The objective of this study was to demonstrate how social network analysis can facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying a social media-based weight loss intervention. Methods: We performed secondary analysis by using data from a pilot study that delivered a dietary and physical activity intervention to a group of participants via Facebook. We mapped out participants' interaction networks over the 12-week intervention period and linked participants'network characteristics (eg, in-degree, out-degree, network constraint) to participants' changes in theoretical mediators (ie, dietary knowledge, perceived social support, self-efficacy) and weight loss by using regression analysis. We also performed mediation analyses to explore how the effects of social network measures on weight loss could be mediated by the aforementioned theoretical mediators. Results: In this analysis, 47 participants from 2 waves completed the study and were included. We found that increases in the number of posts, comments, and reactions significantly predicted weight loss (beta=-.94, P=.04); receiving comments positively predicted changes in self-efficacy (beta=7.81, P=.009), and the degree to which one's network neighbors are tightly connected with each other weakly predicted changes in perceived social support (beta=7.70, P=.08). In addition, change in self-efficacy mediated the relationship between receiving comments and weight loss (beta=-.89, P=.02). Conclusions: Our analyses using data from this pilot study linked participants' network characteristics with changes in several important study outcomes of interest such as self-efficacy, social support, and weight. Our results point to the potential of using social network analysis to understand the social processes and mechanisms through which web-based behavioral interventions affect participants' psychological and behavioral outcomes. Future studies are warranted to validate our results and to further explore the relationship between network dynamics and study outcomes in similar and larger trials.

J	Gautier, L; De Allegri, M; Ridde, V				Gautier, Lara; De Allegri, Manuela; Ridde, Valery			Transnational Networks' Contribution to Health Policy Diffusion: A Mixed Method Study of the Performance-Based Financing Community of Practice in Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						policy pursuing systems reforms; Transnational Policy Networks; Communities of Practice; Social Network Analysis; Semantic Analysis; Performance-Based Sub-Saharan Africa		Background: Transnational networks such as Communities of Practice (CoPs) are flourishing, yet their role in diffusing health systems reforms has been seldom investigated. Over the past decade, performance-based financing (PBF) has rapidly spread in Africa. This study explores how, through the PBF Community of Practice's attributes, structure, and strategies, PBF diffusion was fostered in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: Informed by the diffusion entrepreneurs' (DEs) framework dimensions, we used a mixed methods convergent design to investigate how the attributes, structure, and strategies of this community fostered the diffusion of PBF. The quantitative strand of work included firstly a semantic discourse analysis of textual data extracted from CoP's online discussion forum (n = 1346 posts). Secondly, the relational data extracted from these 1346 forum posts was examined using social network analysis (SNA). We confronted these quantitative results with a thematic analysis of qualitative interviews (n = 40) and data extracted from the CoP's key documentation (n = 17). Results: CoP members' attributes included: representation systems anchored in clinical and economic sciences, strong expectations that the CoP would boost professional visibility and career, and significant health systems knowledge and social resources. The CoP's core group, dominated by high-income country (HIC) members, critically matched PBF principles to major health systems issues in Africa. The broad consensus in online PBF thematic discussions created a strong sense of community, a breeding ground for emulation among CoP members. The CoP also sought to produce and promote experiential knowledge exchanges about PBF amongst African practitioners. Findings from network analyses showed that the promoted Africa-driven community was led by HIC members, although their prominence tended to decrease with time. Conclusion: This empirical research highlighted some of the constituting features, structure, and strategies of policy networks in influencing health policy diffusion. Despite good intentions to disrupt the established governance landscape, influential actors coming from HICs continued to drive the framing, and shaped health systems policy experimentation, emulation, and learning in African countries. Beyond mere knowledge exchange platforms, CoP can act as meaningful transnational policy networks pursuing the diffusion of health systems reforms, such as PBF.

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is one such public-private partnership; in Gavi-eligible countries partnerships are dynamic networks of immunization actors who work together to support all stages and aspects of Gavi support. This paper describes a conceptual framework-the partnership framework-and analytic approach for evaluating the perceptions of partnerships' added value as well as the results from an application to one case in Uganda. Methods: We used a mixed-methods case study design embedded in the Gavi Full Country Evaluations (FCE) to test the partnership framework on Uganda's human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine application partnership. Data from document review, interviews, and social network surveys enabled the testing of the relationships between partnership framework domains (context, structure, practices, performance, and outcomes). Topic guides were based on the framework domains and network surveys identified working together relationships, professional trust, and perceptions of the effectiveness, efficiency, and legitimacy of the partnership's role in this process. Results: Data from seven in-depth interviews, 11 network surveys and document review were analyzed according to the partnership framework, confirming relationships between the framework domains. Trust was an important contributor to the perceived effectiveness of the process. The network was structured around the EPI program, who was considered the leader of this process. While the structure and composition of the network was largely viewed as supporting an effective and legitimate process, the absence of the Ministry of Education (MoE) may have had downstream consequences if this study's results had not been shared with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and acted upon. The partnership was not perceived to have increased the efficiency of the process, perhaps as a result of unclear or absent guidelines around roles and responsibilities. Conclusion: The health and functioning of global health partnerships can be evaluated using the framework and approach presented here. Network theory and methods added value to the conceptual and analytic processes and we recommend applying this approach to other global health partnerships to ensure that they are meeting the complex challenges they were designed to address.

Yet, there is still only limited evidence about individual and institutional best practices for fostering the use of scientific evidence in policy-making processes The present project is the first national-level attempt to (1) map and structurally analyze-quantitatively-health-relevant policy-making networks that connect evidence production, synthesis, interpretation, and use; (2) qualitatively investigate the interaction patterns of a subsample of actors with high centrality metrics within these networks to develop an in-depth understanding of evidence circulation processes; and (3) combine these findings in order to assess a policy network's "absorptive capacity" regarding scientific evidence and integrate them into a conceptually sound and empirically grounded framework. Methods: The project is divided into two research components. The first component is based on quantitative analysis of ties (relationships) that link nodes (participants) in a network. Network data will be collected through a multi-step snowball sampling strategy. Data will be analyzed structurally using social network mapping and analysis methods. The second component is based on qualitative interviews with a subsample of the Web survey participants having central, bridging, or atypical positions in the network. Interviews will focus on the process through which evidence circulates and enters practice. Results from both components will then be integrated through an assessment of the network's and subnetwork's effectiveness in identifying, capturing, interpreting, sharing, reframing, and recodifying scientific evidence in policy-making processes. Discussion: Knowledge developed from this project has the potential both to strengthen the scientific understanding of how policy-level knowledge transfer and exchange functions and to provide significantly improved advice on how to ensure evidence plays a more prominent role in public policies.

This study examines youth's perceived need for and receipt of services through drop-in centers. Surveys of 273 homeless youth. Study Design Extraction Methods Cross-sectional. Descriptive analyses with bivariate and multivariable regression models. Principal Findings Conclusions About one-third to half of the sample met criteria for behavioral health problems, yet half or less of those meeting criteria reported a need for services targeting the problems. Most youth who perceived a need for services received relevant services through a drop-in center, with the exception of care for substance use problems. Youth with behavioral health problems were more likely to perceive a need for services related to housing and case management than those addressing behavioral health problems more directly. Multivariable regression analyses indicated that the factors most strongly associated with perceived need for services were not behavioral health problems, but rather race/ethnicity, traveler status, trouble meeting basic needs, delinquency, abuse/victimization experiences, and trading sex.

Thus, we analyzed the effect of community-based mental health service programs on non-mental health community integration, mediated by mental health community integration. Methods: In total, 190 persons with mental illness (M age = 42.78; SD = 11.3; male, 54.7%; female, 45.3%), living in local communities and using community-based mental health programs, participated in the study. We measured their sociodemographic and clinical variables, the environmental variables of mental health service programs, and the level of integration of the mental health and non-mental health communities. The data collected were analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results: The common significant predictors affecting the two types of community integration were symptoms and resource accessibility: the more accessible the various community resources and the less severe the psychiatric symptoms were, the higher the level of the two types of community integration was. In path analysis, the program's atmosphere and the participation of people with mental illness (program involvement) significantly predicted the level of integration into the mental health community. This, in turn, had a positive effect on their physical integration, social contact frequency, and psychological integration into the non-mental health community, mediated by the integration of the mental health community. Conclusion: Based on the results, we emphasize the importance of mental health communities and suggest strategies to support the integration of mental health communities.

Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2012 and 2013. The study included a process evaluation that analyzed the reach of the OBSA's website, Facebook and Twitter accounts through web metrics and the use made by health professionals in Asturias of these media. Satisfaction was assessed through an online questionnaire. To estimate the potential effects of the OBSA, the study also included an evaluation of the results with a non-experimental design. Results: The total number of visits to the website increased in 2012, with more than 37,000 visits. The questionnaire (n =43) showed that 72.1% of the health professionals knew of the OBSA and that 81.5% of them had used it. Most health professionals reported they were satisfied with the OBSA and believed that it encouraged cooperation among professionals (51.6%). Conclusion: The OBSA is known and consulted by most health professionals and is achieving some of its main objectives: to inform health staff and stimulate discussion. According to the results, information and communication technologies could play an important role in the presentation of health data in a more interactive and accessible way. (C) 2013 SESPAS.

J	Shearer, JC				Shearer, Jessica C.			Policy entrepreneurs and structural influence in integrated community case management policymaking in Burkina Faso	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						C-IMCI; integrated community case management; policy analysis; policy entrepreneur; social network analysis	MORAL CLAIMS; NETWORKS; HEALTH; POWER; KNOWLEDGE; EXERCISE	Policy entrepreneurs are individuals who attempt to influence the policy process and its outcomes through their opportunistic or incremental actions. Their success in the policy-making process has been associated with the convergence of four factors: behavioural traits; institutional factors; network position and political capital. Policy entrepreneurs have received little study in low-and middle-income country policy research despite observations of individualized decision-making, informal institutions and the unequal distribution and exercise of power in policymaking. This article aims to identify whether policy entrepreneurs were present in the policy process around integrated community case management (iCCM) in Burkina Faso, whether they were successful in achieving policy change, and whether success or failure can be explained using existing policy entrepreneur frameworks from high-income polities. This mixed methods policy study collected data from in-depth qualitative interviews and social network surveys of actors involved in iCCM policymaking [known locally as C-integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)]; data were analysed based on the framework categories. Interview data pointed to one key individual who played a significant role in the inclusion of pneumonia treatment into the country's iCCM policy, an issue that had been a point of contention between government policy elites and development partners. Social network data confirmed that this actor was strategically located in the policy network to be able to reach the most other actors and to be able to control the flow of information. Although some development partner actors were as strategically located, none had the same level of authority or trust as was imbued by being a member of the government civil service. The entrepreneur's mid-level rank in the health ministry may have encouraged him/her to invest political capital and take risks that would not have been feasible or attractive to a more senior actor.

A randomized wait-list controlled trial of a social support intervention for caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain tumor	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Caregiver; Oncology; Social support; Psychosocial intervention; Clinical navigation; mHealth	GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; ADVANCED CANCER-PATIENTS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; HEART-FAILURE; MENTAL-HEALTH; BURDEN; CARE; PREDICTORS; SYMPTOMS	BackgroundInformal family caregivers constitute an important and increasingly demanding role in the cancer healthcare system. This is especially true for caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain tumors based on the rapid progression of disease, including physical and cognitive debilitation. Informal social network resources such as friends and family can provide social support to caregivers, which lowers caregiver burden and improves overall quality of life. However, barriers to obtaining needed social support exist for caregivers. To address this need, our team developed and is assessing a multi-component caregiver support intervention that uses a blend of technology and personal contact to improve caregiver social support.MethodsWe are currently conducting a prospective, longitudinal 2-group randomized controlled trial which compares caregivers who receive the intervention to a wait-list control group. Only caregivers directly receive the intervention, but the patient-caregiver dyads are enrolled so we can assess outcomes in both. The 8-week intervention consists of two components: (1) The electronic Social Network Assessment Program, a web-based tool to visualize existing social support resources and provide a tailored list of additional resources; and (2) Caregiver Navigation, including weekly phone sessions with a Caregiver Navigator to address caregiver social support needs. Outcomes are assessed by questionnaires completed by the caregiver (baseline, 4-week, 8-week) and the cancer patient (baseline, and 8-week). At 8weeks, caregivers in the wait-list condition may opt into the intervention. Our primary outcome is caregiver well-being; we also explore patient well-being and caregiver and patient health care utilization.DiscussionThis protocol describes a study testing a novel social support intervention that pairs a web-based social network visualization tool and resource list (eSNAP) with personalized caregiver navigation. This intervention is responsive to a family-centered model of care and calls for clinical and research priorities focused on informal caregiving research.Trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov, Registration number: NCT04268979; Date of registration: February 10, 2020, retrospectively registered.

Innovations in e-health was one of four plenary panels. E-health is changing the landscape of clinical practice and health care, but the best way to leverage the many promised benefits of emerging e-health technologies is still not clear. The Innovations in e-health panel presented emerging changes in technologies and applications that will facilitate clinical decision making, improve quality and efficiency of care, engage individuals in clinical decision making, and empower them to adopt healthy behaviors. The purpose of this paper was to present emerging trends in e-health and considerations for successful adoption of new technologies, and an overview of each of the presentations in the e-health plenary. The presentations included a personal perspective on the use of technology for self-monitoring in Parkinson's disease, an overview of online social networks and emerging technologies, and the collection of patient-reported outcomes through web-based systems in clinical practice. The common thread across all the talks was the application of e-health tools to empower individuals with chronic disease to be actively engaged in the management of their health. Considerations regarding data ownership and privacy, universal access to e-health, interactivity between different types of e-health technologies, and tailoring applications to individual needs were explored.

Applications and Recruitment Performance of Web-Based Respondent-Driven Sampling: Scoping Review	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Review						respondent-driven sampling; webRDS; online sampling; public health; interventions; research methodology; hard-to-reach populations; probabilistic sampling	HIDDEN POPULATIONS; NETWORK; ONLINE; SNOWBALL; REACH	Background: Web-based respondent-driven sampling is a novel sampling method for the recruitment of participants for generating population estimates, studying social network characteristics, and delivering health interventions. However, the application, barriers and facilitators, and recruitment performance of web-based respondent-driven sampling have not yet been systematically investigated. Objective: Our objectives were to provide an overview of published research using web-based respondent-driven sampling and to investigate factors related to the recruitment performance of web-based respondent-driven sampling. Methods: We conducted a scoping review on web-based respondent-driven sampling studies published between 2000 and 2019. We used the process evaluation of complex interventions framework to gain insights into how web-based respondent-driven sampling was implemented, what mechanisms of impact drove recruitment, what the role of context was in the study, and how these components together influenced the recruitment performance of web-based respondent-driven sampling. Results: We included 18 studies from 8 countries (high- and low-middle income countries), in which web-based respondent-driven sampling was used for making population estimates (n=12), studying social network characteristics (n=3), and delivering health-related interventions (n=3). Studies used web-based respondent-driven sampling to recruit between 19 and 3448 participants from a variety of target populations. Studies differed greatly in the number of seeds recruited, the proportion of successfully recruiting participants, the number of recruitment waves, the type of incentives offered to participants, and the duration of data collection. Studies that recruited relatively more seeds, through online platforms, and with less rigorous selection procedures reported relatively low percentages of successfully recruiting seeds. Studies that did not offer at least one guaranteed material incentive reported relatively fewer waves and lower percentages of successfully recruiting participants. The time of data collection was shortest in studies with university students. Conclusions: Web-based respondent-driven sampling can be successfully applied to recruit individuals for making population estimates, studying social network characteristics, and delivering health interventions. In general, seed and peer recruitment may be enhanced by rigorously selecting and motivating seeds, offering at least one guaranteed material incentive, and facilitating adequate recruitment options regarding the target population's online connectedness and communication behavior. Potential trade-offs should be taken into account when implementing web-based respondent-driven sampling, such as having less opportunities to implement rigorous seed selection procedures when recruiting many seeds, as well as issues around online rather than physical participation, such as the risk of cheaters participating repeatedly.

In this exploratory study, we analyzed 1352 messages posted to an active Facebook diabetes group to identify the characteristics of the group. The results revealed that the group was international in nature. Users overcame language barriers to communicate with people with similar conditions. Users' interactions were structured around information, emotion, and community building. They exchanged medical and lifestyle information, and highly valued their peers' personal experiences, opinions, and advice. They also demonstrated a positive attitude toward the reality of living with diabetes and generously provided encouragements and affirmations to one another. Great efforts were made to maintain the proper operation of the community by the administrator and a group of core members. As a result, the group was shaped as a social network where peer users share social support, cultivate companionship, and exert social influence. Based on the results, we discussed future directions for research of health communities in a highly connected world.

J	Liu, F; Li, YY; Ju, XF				Liu, Fei; Li, Yingying; Ju, Xiaofeng			Exploring Patients' Consultation Behaviors in the Online Health Community: The Role of Disease Risk	TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH			English	Article						online health communities; disease risk; service reviews; e-health	INFORMATION-SEEKING; CONSUMER REVIEWS; E-MAIL; INTERNET; CANCER; IMPACT; PRODUCT	Introduction:An online health community (OHC) is a unique social network that provides a platform for sharing healthcare information, communicating about health and offering health services. While many researchers have examined OHCs, the impact of patient reviews on patient consultation behavior in the OHCs has rarely been discussed in the existing literature.Methods:A computer program was developed to download the required information. This process was conducted monthly to capture the variation in the dependent variable.Results:By analyzing data from 907 physicians from the Good Doctor Online website, we found that online and offline patient reviews significantly affected the number of patient telephone consultations. In addition, disease risk significantly moderated the relationship between reviews and telephone consultations. Patients with high-risk diseases tended to pay more attention to offline patient reviews. In contrast, patients with low-risk diseases paid more attention to online service reviews.Conclusion:It is important to explore the underlying mechanisms by which online versus offline reviews influence patients to undertake certain behaviors. This study aimed to explore the impact of online and offline reviews on patients' consultation behaviors and examine the moderating role of disease risk. Our results have implications for existing health management and e-health literature.

A Personal Health Network for Chemotherapy Care Coordination: Evaluation of Usability Among Patients	NURSING INFORMATICS 2016: EHEALTH FOR ALL: EVERY LEVEL COLLABORATION - FROM PROJECT TO REALIZATION	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Nursing Informatics	JUN 25-29, 2016	Geneva, SWITZERLAND			Care coordination; oncology; chemotherapy; person-centered; mobile technology; social network	CANCER CARE; TECHNOLOGY	Cancer is a top concern globally. Cancer care suffers from lack of coordination, silos of information, and high cost. Interest is emerging in person-centered technology to assist with coordination to address these challenges. This study evaluates the usability of the "personal health network" (PHN), a novel solution leveraging social networking and mobile technologies, among individuals undergoing chemotherapy and receiving care coordination. Early results from interviews of 12 participants in a randomized pragmatic trial suggest that they feel more connected to the healthcare team using the PHN, find value in access to the patient education library, and are better equipped to organize the many activities that occur during chemotherapy. Improvements are needed in navigation, connectivity, and integration with electronic health records. Findings contribute to improvements in the PHN and informs a roadmap for potentially greater impact in technology-enabled cancer care coordination.

One of the main outputs of the project is a collaborative platform which integrates a myriad of research and learning resources. This article presents the first prototype of this platform: the AFRICA BUILD Portal (ABP 1.0). The ABP is a Web 2.0 platform which facilitates the access, in a collaborative manner, to these resources. Through a usable web interface, the ABP has been designed to avoid, as much as possible, the connectivity problems of African institutions. In this paper, we suggest that the access to complex systems does not imply slow response rates, and that their development model guides the project to a natural technological transfer, adaptation and user acceptance. Finally, this platform aims to motivate research attitudes during the learning process and stimulate user's collaboration.

This study applied a mixed-method approach to examine the IPP and learning occurring in a youth mental health service in Tasmania, Australia. The aims of the study were to investigate the extent to which staff were networked, how collaboratively they practiced and supported student learning, and to elicit the organisation's strengths and opportunities regarding IPP and learning. Six data sets were collected: pre-and post-test readiness for interprofessional learning surveys, Social Network survey, organisational readiness for IPP and learning checklist, "talking wall" role clarification activity, and observations of participants working through a clinical case study. Participants (n = 19) were well-networked and demonstrated a patient-centred approach. Results confirmed participants' positive attitudes to IPP and learning and identified ways to strengthen the organisation's interprofessional capability. This mixed-method approach could assist others to investigate IPP and learning.

More women reported depression in the interviews than through their Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) responses. Quantitative data revealed 57% of the women had ever received mental health help (80% of university vs. 45% of community sample). There was a range of satisfaction reported for various types of mental health care, with satisfaction being the highest for spiritual/religious advisor/folk healer. During the interviews, one woman reported that she is currently receiving professional care and five women are seeking help from their family/social network. Future research should explore reasons for the differences in the quantitative and qualitative findings regarding depression and associated help-seeking as well as in the satisfaction levels by type of help-seeking.

This paper presents a pilot program based on a technological solution to improve the nutrition and physical activity habits in children. The solution is a multiplatform application that can be accessed both from computers and mobile devices. A study of current, similar solutions was carried out and a web application was designed and built, combining information on healthy nutrition and physical activity habits with the functionalities of an online social network. This application was used to carry out a pilot intervention with children from the first and second years of Compulsory Secondary Education (CSE) at a school in Spain. After the pilot program, feedback was received from the users, obtaining valuable information for introducing a number of improvements that will be incorporated into a future program.

Using a case study of an OHC among breast cancer survivors, we revealed the types of social support embedded in each post using text-mining techniques. Then we aggregated users' activities related to different types of social support and identified different roles that users play in an OHC via unsupervised machine learning techniques. By analyzing how users' roles change over time, we constructed a transition graph to illustrate the evolution of users' roles in the OHC. We also discovered that a user's reception of social support is correlated with the evolution of her role. In addition, by examining whom a user interacted with, we found evidence for "role diffusion"--users tend to adopt roles of her network neighbors. Our research has implications for OHC operators to manage and sustain an OHC.

J	Czapka, EA; Sagbakken, M				Czapka, Elzbieta Anna; Sagbakken, Mette			"Where to find those doctors?" A qualitative study on barriers and facilitators in access to and utilization of health care services by Polish migrants in Norway	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Polish migrants; Access to health services; Barriers; Facilitators	ETHNIC-MINORITIES; EXPERIENCES; IMMIGRANTS; WORKERS; VIEWS; WOMEN; NO	Background: Poles constitute the largest group of migrants in Norway. Research confirms a steady inflow and a minimal outflow of Polish migrants. One of the key aspects of migrants' structural integration is access to health care services. This study explored barriers to and facilitators of Polish migrants' access to Norwegian health care services. Methods: A qualitative interview-based study was carried out between November 2013 and July 2014. The study is part of a larger, ongoing mixed-method study of Polish migrants' access to health care services in Norway. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 Polish migrants in Oslo. The interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed. Thematic analysis was performed to identify barriers and facilitators related to the use of Norwegian health care services. Results: Migrants experienced several barriers to and facilitators of access to health care services in Norway. The barriers most often mentioned were problems resulting from insufficient command of the language, related communication problems, and lack of knowledge about navigating the Norwegian health care system. Other barriers related to the organization of the health care system, perceptions of doctors' skills and practices, and attitudes among health personnel. Factors such as having a Polish social network, meeting friendly health personnel, and perceptions of equal treatment of all patients, facilitated access to and use of health care services. Conclusions: The study shows that there are both system-and patient-related barriers to and facilitators of migrants' access to health services in Norway. These findings suggest that successful inclusion of migrants into the Norwegian health system requires regular evaluation of access and utilization of health care services.

HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Community-based care; Integrated care; Health needs assessment; Predictive risk models; Triple Aim	CARE UTILIZATION; MULTIMORBIDITY	Introduction: To support providers and commissioners in accurately assessing their local populations' health needs, this study produces an overview of Dutch predictive risk models for health care, focusing specifically on the type, combination and relevance of included determinants for achieving the Triple Aim (improved health, better care experience, and lower costs). Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study combining document analyses, interviews and a Delphi study. Predictive risk models were identified based on a web search and expert input. Participating in the study were Dutch experts in predictive risk modelling (interviews; n =11) and experts in healthcare delivery, insurance and/or funding methodology (Delphi panel; n = 15). Results: Ten predictive risk models were analysed, comprising 17 unique determinants. Twelve were considered relevant by experts for estimating community health needs. Although some compositional similarities were identified between models, the combination and operationalisation of determinants varied considerably. Conclusions: Existing predictive risk models provide a good starting point, but optimally balancing resources and targeting interventions on the community level will likely require a more holistic approach to health needs assessment. Development of additional determinants, such as measures of people's lifestyle and social network, may require policies pushing the integration of routine data from different (healthcare) sources.

Characteristics of patients seeking health information online via social health networks versus general Internet sites: a comparative study	INFORMATICS FOR HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE			English	Article						Chronic illness; internet users; social network; social health network	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; THEMATIC ANALYSIS; CANCER ONLINE; SUPPORT; COMMUNICATION; BREAST; PARTICIPATION; EXPLORATION	Background: Camoni.co.il, a Hebrew-language social health network offers advice, consultation, and connection to others with chronic illness. This study compared characteristics and objectives of Camoni.co.il users and individuals seeking medical information through general Internet sites. Methods: Similar questionnaires were sent to 1009 Internet and 900 Camoni users. Cluster analysis defined four modes of online social health network use: "acquiring information and support", "communicating", "networking" and "browsing". Results: Six hundred and five Internet and 125 Camoni users responded. Diabetes, hypertension, obesity and lung diseases were found more often among general Internet users than Camoni users. Among Camoni users, "acquiring information and support" was the main motivation for individuals over age 55 years, women, those with lower income, chronic pain, obesity and depression. "Communicating" was the main incentive of men, those 20-34 years old, those with less education, or an eating disorder. "Networking" was the most significant motivation for those with multiple sclerosis or depression. Browsing was most frequent among individuals with multiple sclerosis. Conclusions: Identifying needs of social health network surfers will allow planning unique contents and enhancing social health sites. Physicians might advise patients to use them to obtain support and information regarding their conditions, possibly leading to improved compliance and self-management.

J	Matlala, SF				Matlala, Sogo F.			A model to facilitate collaborative social support for pregnant students in secondary schools	JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE			English	Article						communication; health team; learner pregnancy; maternal and child health; school health services; social network	ADOLESCENTS; AFRICA	Pregnancy among secondary school students remains a public health problem and is associated with school dropout as well as poor maternal and child health outcomes. Schools in South Africa no longer expel pregnant students as was the case before 2000. Instead, the government encourages them to remain in class to complete their education, but pregnant students often face stigma, and some drop out of school as a result. To remain in class and access antenatal care, pregnant students require social support from teachers, parents and professional nurses. Unfortunately, teachers, parents and professional nurses support pregnant students on an ad hoc basis, and this calls for a model to facilitate collaborative social support. The purpose of this paper is to present and describe a model to facilitate collaborative social support for pregnant students attending secondary schools in South Africa, using the model description steps of Chinn and Kramer. The model is designed as a tool to enable pregnant students to remain in school, attend antenatal care and in the end, deliver healthy babies. The professional nurse, as a member and leader of the school health team which visits secondary schools to provide a package of school health services, is the agent or facilitator of the model.

Objective This study explored the concept of a health network, relationships focused on health-related matters, and examined associations with CVD risk factors in the Eastern Caribbean. Design The Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network Cohort Study is an ongoing longitudinal cohort being conducted in the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados. Participants Participants (n = 1989) were English or Spanish-speaking adults 40 years and older, who were residents of the island for at least 10 years, and who intended to live on-island for the next 5 years. Main Measures Logistic regression was used to examine associations between health network characteristics and CVD risk factors: physical activity, hypertension, and smoking. A baseline survey asked questions about health networks using name generator questions that assessed who participants spoke to about health matters, whose opinions on healthcare mattered, and who they would trust to make healthcare decisions on their behalf. Key Results Health networks were mainly comprised of family members and friends. Healthcare professionals comprised 7% of networks, mean network size was four, and 74% of health network contacts were perceived to be in "good" to "excellent" health. Persons with larger health networks had greater odds of being physically active compared with those with smaller networks (OR = 1.07, CI = 1.01-1.14). Conclusions Health networks may be useful to intervention efforts for CVD risk factor reduction. More studies are needed to examine health networks in Caribbean contexts and explore associations with other CVD risk factors.

J	Thompson, VLS				Thompson, Vetta L. Sanders			Making decisions in a complex information environment: evidential preference and information we trust	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Eisenberg-Center Conference on Supporting Informed Decision Making When Clinical Evidence and Conventional Wisdom Collide	SEP 13, 2012	Rockville, MD	Eisenberg Ctr			CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS; HEALTH INFORMATION; BLACK NEWSPAPERS; CANCER; COMMUNICATION; DISPARITIES; BEHAVIORS; SEEKING	Background: Informed decision making requires that those individuals making health and health-care decisions understand the advantages and disadvantages associated with particular health options. Research and theory suggest factors that contribute to the decision-making process: data on the likelihood of risks and benefits, level of certainty about outcomes, familiarity with the health issue, characteristics of information sources and presentation, and patient values and beliefs. As the health information environment increases in complexity, it becomes important to understand how interactions among information sources, family, and friends may affect the processing of health information and choices and their alignment with available evidence. Analysis: This paper discusses the potential interactions among social networks, information sources and evidential preferences for health information as they influence health decisions. The role of family and friends who increasingly search for health information for others and the potential for information filtering influenced by second-or third-party attitudes and preferences is explored. Evidential preferences suggestive of the potential value of social math (creatively presented statistics) strategies for presenting data, the information-processing factors that may make personal experiences, anecdotes and testimonials that are often shared within social networks and may exert powerful influences on health decisions are examined in this article. Conclusions: The paper concludes with recommendations for revised health-communication practices, health professional training to improve patient understanding in the clinical encounter, and directions for future research. Simple, direct, and socially relevant communications that avoid conflicts with the values and beliefs of the individual, as well as those of the family and social network, are recommended.

Exploring the Internet Usage Patterns of the Urban Poor: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						health communication; socioeconomic factors; information-seeking behavior; Internet	DIGITAL DIVIDE; INFORMATION; COMMUNICATION; INEQUALITIES; POPULATIONS; CHILDREN; SEEKING; GAPS	Background: Important gaps remain in our knowledge of how individuals from low socioeconomic position (SEP) use the Internet for resources and in understanding the full range of activities they perform online. Although self-report data indicate that low SEP individuals use the Internet less than high SEP people for health information and for other beneficial capital-enhancing activities, these results may not provide an accurate overall view of online use. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the ways in which low SEP individuals use the Internet, including for entertainment, social networking, and capital-enhancing functions, and how they are associated with health information seeking. Methods: Detailed Web tracking data were collected from 118 low SEP individuals who participated in the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial that provided Internet access. Websites were grouped by topic, including categories of capital-enhancing websites that provided access to resources and information. Different types of online activities were summed into an Internet use index. Single and multiple negative binomial regression models were fitted with the Internet use index as the predictor and health information seeking as the outcome. Next, models were fitted with low, medium, and high Web usage in capital-enhancing, entertainment, and social network categories to determine their associations with health information seeking. Results: Participants used the Web for diverse purposes, with 63.6% (75/118) accessing the Internet for all defined types of Internet use. Each additional category of Internet use was associated with 2.12 times the rate of health information seeking (95% CI 1.84-2.44, P<.001). Higher use of each type of capital-enhancing information was associated with higher rates of health information seeking, with high uses of government (incident rate ratio [IRR] 8.90, 95% CI 4.82-16.42, P<.001) and news (IRR 11.36, 95% CI 6.21-20.79, P<.001) websites associated with the highest rates of health information seeking compared to their lowest use categories. High entertainment website use (IRR 3.91, 95% CI 2.07-7.37, P<.001) and high social network use (IRR 2.06, 95% CI 1.08-3.92, P=.03) were also associated with higher health information seeking. Conclusions: These data clearly show that familiarity and skills in using the Internet enhance the capacity to use it for diverse purposes, including health and to increase capital, and that Internet usage for specific activities is not a zero sum game. Using it for one type of topic, such as entertainment, does not detract from using it for other purposes. Findings may inform ways to engage low SEP groups with Internet resources.

J	Wu, TL; He, ZF; Zhang, DL				Wu, Tailai; He, Zhifei; Zhang, Donglan			Impact of Communicating With Doctors Via Social Media on Consumers' E-Health Literacy and Healthy Behaviors in China	INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING			English	Article						communication; social media; e-health literacy; healthy behaviors		This study investigated the relationship between consumers' communication with doctors and their e-Health literacy and healthy behaviors based on the theory of reasoned action. Five communication activities were identified: following doctors' social media accounts, reading doctors' posts, responding to doctors' posts, favoring (clicking "like" of) doctors' posts, and recommending doctors to other patients. E-Health literacy and healthy behaviors were measured based on instruments used in previous literature. Survey method was used to collect data and a hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between communication activities and consumers' e-Health literacy and healthy behaviors. We found that following doctors' accounts (r = 0.127, P < .001), responding to doctors' posts (r = 0.141, P < .001) and recommending doctors to others (r = 0.133, P < .001) were significantly associated with e-Health literacy, while following doctors' accounts (r = 0.091, P < .001), responding to doctors' post (r = 0.072, P < .01), favoring doctors' posts (r = 0.129, P < .001), and recommending doctors to others (r = 0.220, P < .001) were significantly associated with healthy behaviors. Our study demonstrated that the social network communication between doctors and consumers could be cost-effective in improving intermediary consumers' health outcomes. To be specific, following doctors' posts, responding to doctors' posts, favoring doctors' posts, and recommending doctors to others were positively associated with consumers' e-Health literacy and healthy behaviors. The results suggested that leveraging information technology could be an important tool to health policymakers and health providers in order to improve outcomes.

An annotated question corpus is prerequisite for training machines to understand health information needs of users. Thus, we aimed to develop an annotated classification corpus of Chinese health questions (Qcorp) and make it openly accessible. Methods: We developed a two-layered classification schema and corresponding annotation rules on basis of our previous work. Using the schema, we annotated 5000 questions that were randomly selected from 5 Chinese health websites within 6 broad sections. 8 annotators participated in the annotation task, and the inter-annotator agreement was evaluated to ensure the corpus quality. Furthermore, the distribution and relationship of the annotated tags were measured by descriptive statistics and social network map. Results: The questions were annotated using 7101 tags that covers 29 topic categories in the two-layered schema. In our released corpus, the distribution of questions on the top-layered categories was treatment of 64.22%, diagnosis of 37.14%, epidemiology of 14.96%, healthy lifestyle of 10.38%, and health provider choice of 4.54% respectively. Both the annotated health questions and annotation schema were openly accessible on the Qcorp website. Users can download the annotated Chinese questions in CSV, XML, and HTML format. Conclusions: We developed a Chinese health question corpus including 5000 manually annotated questions. It is openly accessible and would contribute to the intelligent health QA system development.

This makes early detection of depressive symptoms critical in its prevention and management. This paper presents and discusses the development of Psychologist in a Pocket (PiaP), a mental mHealth application for Android which screens and monitors for these symptoms, and-given the explicit permission of the user-alerts a trusted contact such as the mental health professional or a close friend, if it detects symptoms. All text inputted electronically-such as short message services, emails, social network posts-is analyzed based on keywords related to depression based on DSM-5 and ICD criteria as well as Beck's Cognitive Theory of Depression and the Self-Focus Model. Data evaluation and collection happen in the background, ondevice, without requiring any user involvement. Currently, the application is in an early prototype phase entering initial clinical validation.

In doing so, this study examines implementation leadership in orthopaedic surgery to explain leadership as a collective endeavour which cannot be separated from the organisational context. Methods A mixed-method study consisting of longitudinal and cross-sectional interviews and an embedded social network analysis will be performed in six NHS hospitals. A social network analysis will be undertaken in each hospital to uncover the organisational networks, the focal leadership actors and information flows in each organisation. This will be followed by a series of repeated semi-structured interviews, conducted over 4 years, with orthopaedic surgeons and their professional networks. These longitudinal interviews will be supplemented by cross-sectional interviews with the national established surgical leaders. All qualitative data will be analysed using a constructivist grounded theory approach and integrated with the quantitative data. The participant narratives will enrich the social network to uncover the leadership configurations which exist, and how different configurations of leadership are functioning in practice to influence implementation processes and outcomes. Discussion The study findings will facilitate understanding about how and why different configurations of leadership develop and under what organisational conditions and circumstances they are able to flourish. The study will guide the development of leadership interventions that are grounded in the data and aimed at advancing leadership for service improvement in orthopaedics. The strength of the study lies in the combination of multi-component, multi-site, multi-agent methods to examine leadership processes in surgery. The findings may be limited by the practical challenges of longitudinal qualitative data collection, such as ensuring participant retention, which need to be balanced against the theoretical and empirical insights generated through this comprehensive exploration of leadership across and within a range of healthcare organisations.

Our objective was to describe HRQoL in NVAF patients on oral anticoagulation, focusing on uncontrolled patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) versus controlled patients on VKAs or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), in a real-world setting. Additionally, we assessed the clinical characteristics of patients with uncontrolled anticoagulation. Methods An observational, multicentre, and cross-sectional study, enrolling 38 Spanish Hospitals' Internal Medicine Departments. HRQoL was assessed using the validated Spanish version of the Sawicki questionnaire. High self-perceived HRQoL was indicated by high scores in the general treatment satisfaction and self-efficacy dimensions, and by low scores in the strained social network, daily hassles and distress dimensions. Results Five hundred and one patients were included for assessment. Mean scores +/- SD were closer to a high perceived HRQoL in controlled than uncontrolled patients for the five dimensions of the questionnaire: 4.9 +/- 1.0 versus 3.6 +/- 1.3 for general treatment satisfaction; 4.3 +/- 1.0 versus 3.6 +/- 1.0 for self-efficacy, 3.1 +/- 0.9 versus 3.9 +/- 1.1 for strained social network, 2.1 +/- 0.8 versus 3.0 +/- 1.0 for daily hassles and 1.8 +/- 0.9 versus 2.6 +/- 1.2 for distress. Conclusions HRQoL in patients with controlled anticoagulant status treated with NOACs or VKAs was better than in patients with uncontrolled anticoagulant status. This seems to indicate that anticoagulation control status influences perception of HRQoL, highlighting the importance of its evaluation when assessing HRQoL in NVAF patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact, in the first 2.5years, of this role across a range of variables.MethodsMultiple methods were used to gather a comprehensive range of data. Workforce surveys were completed both online and in hard copy in early 2014 (n=42) and late 2016 (n=44). Research key performance indicators (academic, research production and cultural) were also identified for measurement over time. The data from these surveys were analysed using descriptive and inductive analysis, and also with social network analysis.ResultsThis role has demonstrated positive outcomes across a range of variables. There was a medium effect on the quantity of participation in quality assurance and knowledge translation activities by the workforce. Most knowledge translation behaviours were occurring regularly, although several were absent. An improving trend in attitudes towards evidence-based practice was recorded, and perceptions of the knowledge translation role were generally positive. The Lead Research Occupational Therapist moved from the periphery to the centre of the evidence based practice social network. Improved awareness of other clinicians deploying evidence based practice was observed, and the frequency of interaction between clinicians increased. The role has met all key performance indicators, across the academic, research production and cultural domains.ConclusionsThe shift in focus of this role from research to knowledge translation has produced tangible outcomes for the occupational therapy workforce. These achievements have had a positive impact on the sustainability of the role, which will be continued for at least another two years.

Visualization and analytics tools for infectious disease epidemiology: A systematic review	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Review						Visualization; Infectious disease; Public health; Disease surveillance; GIS; Social network analysis	PUBLIC-HEALTH PRACTITIONERS; GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEM; TRANSMISSION NETWORK ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; VISUAL EXPLORATION; EPI INFO; SURVEILLANCE; NEEDS; DESIGN; RISK	Background: A myriad of new tools and algorithms have been developed to help public health professionals analyze and visualize the complex data used in infectious disease control. To better understand approaches to meet these users' information needs, we conducted a systematic literature review focused on the landscape of infectious disease visualization tools for public health professionals, with a special emphasis on geographic information systems (GIS), molecular epidemiology, and social network analysis. The objectives of this review are to: (1) identify public health user needs and preferences for infectious disease information visualization tools; (2) identify existing infectious disease information visualization tools and characterize their architecture and features; (3) identify commonalities among approaches applied to different data types; and (4) describe tool usability evaluation efforts and barriers to the adoption of such tools. Methods: We identified articles published in English from January 1, 1980 to June 30, 2013 from five bibliographic databases. Articles with a primary focus on infectious disease visualization tools, needs of public health users, or usability of information visualizations were included in the review. Results: A total of 88 articles met our inclusion criteria. Users were found to have diverse needs, preferences and uses for infectious disease visualization tools, and the existing tools are correspondingly diverse. The architecture of the tools was inconsistently described, and few tools in the review discussed the incorporation of usability studies or plans for dissemination. Many studies identified concerns regarding data sharing, confidentiality and quality. Existing tools offer a range of features and functions that allow users to explore, analyze, and visualize their data, but the tools are often for siloed applications. Commonly cited barriers to widespread adoption included lack of organizational support, access issues, and misconceptions about tool use. Discussion and conclusion: As the volume and complexity of infectious disease data increases, public health professionals must synthesize highly disparate data to facilitate communication with the public and inform decisions regarding measures to protect the public's health. Our review identified several themes: consideration of users' needs, preferences, and computer literacy; integration of tools into routine workflow; complications associated with understanding and use of visualizations; and the role of user trust and organizational support in the adoption of these tools. Interoperability also emerged as a prominent theme, highlighting challenges associated with the increasingly collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of infectious disease control and prevention. Future work should address methods for representing uncertainty and missing data to avoid misleading users as well as strategies to minimize cognitive overload. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Patient Participation at Health Care Conferences: Engaged Patients Increase Information Flow, Expand Propagation, and Deepen Engagement in the Conversation of Tweets Compared to Physicians or Researchers	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social media; patients; physicians; patient participation; congresses as topic; social networking, network analysis	SOCIAL MEDIA; MEDICINE CONFERENCE; COMPLEX NETWORKS; TWITTER USE; UROLOGY; IMPACT	Background: Health care conferences present a unique opportunity to network, spark innovation, and disseminate novel information to a large audience, but the dissemination of information typically stays within very specific networks. Social network analysis can be adopted to understand the flow of information between virtual social communities and the role of patients within the network. Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact engaged patients bring to health care conference social media information flow and how they expand dissemination and distribution of tweets compared to other health care conference stakeholders such as physicians and researchers. Methods: From January 2014 through December 2016, 7,644,549 tweets were analyzed from 1672 health care conferences with at least 1000 tweets who had registered in Symplur's Health Care Hashtag Project from 2014 to 2016. The tweet content was analyzed to create a list of the top 100 influencers by mention from each conference, who were then subsequently categorized by stakeholder group. Multivariate linear regression models were created using stepwise function building to identify factors explaining variability as predictor variables for the model in which conference tweets were taken as the dependent variable. Results: Inclusion of engaged patients in health care conference social media was low compared to that of physicians and has not significantly changed over the last 3 years. When engaged patient voices are included in health care conferences, they greatly increase information flow as measured by total tweet volume (beta=301.6) compared to physicians (beta=137.3, P<.001), expand propagation of information tweeted during a conference as measured by social media impressions created (beta=1,700,000) compared to physicians (beta=270,000, P<.001), and deepen engagement in the tweet conversation as measured by replies to their tweets (beta=24.4) compared to physicians (beta=5.5, P<.001). Social network analysis of hubs and authorities revealed that patients had statistically significant higher hub scores (mean 8.26x10-4, SD 2.96x10-4) compared to other stakeholder groups' Twitter accounts (mean 7.19x10-4, SD 3.81x10-4; t273.84=4.302, P<.001). Conclusions: Although engaged patients are powerful accelerators of information flow, expanders of tweet propagation, and greatly deepen engagement in conversation of tweets on social media of health care conferences compared to physicians, they represent only 1.4% of the stakeholder mix of the top 100 influencers in the conversation. Health care conferences that fail to engage patients in their proceedings may risk limiting their engagement with the public, disseminating scientific information to a narrow community and slowing flow of information across social media channels.

Objective: This study aimed to test the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility for a mobile social network (WeChat)-based smoking cessation intervention (SCAMPI program) among Chinese male smokers. Methods: Chinese male smokers aged 25-44 years were recruited online from WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China Individuals using other smoking cessation interventions or who lacked capacity to provide online informed consent were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control groups. Neither participants nor researchers were masked to assignment. The trial was fully online. All data were collected via WeChat. The intervention group received access to the full-version SCAMPI program, a Chinese-language smoking cessation program based on the Behaviour Change Wheel framework and relevant cessation guidelines. Specific intervention functions used in the program include . planning to help users make quitting plans, calculator to record quitting benefits, calendar to record progress, gamification to facilitate quitting, information about smoking harms, motivational messages to help users overcome urges, standardized tests for users to assess their levels of nicotine dependence and lung health, as well as a social platform to encourage social support between users. The control group had access to a static WeChat page of contacts for standard smoking cessation care. Both groups received incentive credit payments for participating. The primary outcome was 30-day biochemically verified smoking abstinence at 6 weeks after randomization, with missing data treated as not quitting. Secondary outcomes were other smoking status measures, reduction of cigarette consumption, study feasibility (recruitment and retention rate), and acceptability of and satisfaction with the program. Results: The program recorded 5736 visitors over a 13-day recruitment period. We recruited 80 participants who were randomly allocated to two arms (n=40 per arm). At 6 weeks, 36 of 40 (90%) intervention participants and 35 of 40 (88%) control participants provided complete self-reported data on their daily smoking status via WeChat. Biochemically verified smoking abstinence at 6 weeks was determined for 10 of 40 (25%) intervention participants and 2 of 40 (5%) control participants (RR=5, 95% CI 1.2-21.4, P=.03). In the intervention group, the calculator function, motivational messages, and health tests were underused (less than once per week per users). Participants rated their satisfaction with the intervention program as 4.56 out of 5.00. Conclusions: Our program is a novel, accessible, and acceptable smoking cessation intervention for Chinese male smokers. A future trial with a greater sample size and longer follow-up will identify if it is as effective as these preliminary data suggest.

J	Quinlan, E; Robertson, S				Quinlan, Elizabeth; Robertson, Susan			Mutual understanding in multi-disciplinary primary health care teams	JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE			English	Article						Multi-disciplinary health care teams; team-based clinical decision-making; knowledge exchange; collective work organization	NURSE-PRACTITIONERS; DECISION-MAKING; COMMUNICATION; COLLABORATION; PHYSICIANS; QUALITY; WORKERS	Empirical research on multi-disciplinary health care teams has yet to explore the development of mutual understanding between team members in the course of their collective clinical decision-making. This paper addresses this gap in the literature directly by examining changes in mutual understanding and the extent to which its facilitation is shared by individual members of multidisciplinary health care teams. A Habcrmasian theoretical framework is used to operationalize mutual understanding. Social network analysis is used to analyze survey data on team-based clinical decision-making collected from multi-disciplinary health care teams in a Canadian province. The results of the study indicate that mutual understanding between team members ebbs and flows over the course of their collective clinical decisions. Further, as the extent of mutual understanding within the team increases, its facilitation becomes more equally shared among team members. The paper closes by specifying a practical outcome of the future work: a typology of clinical decisions that health care teams are able to use as an evaluation tool to assess how effectively they are making collective clinical decisions. As an evaluation tool, the typology would foster open and deliberative discussion, enable critical self-reflection, and thereby further enhancing mutual understanding within the teams.

J	Nebeker, C; Dunseath, SE; Linares-Orozco, R				Nebeker, Camille; Dunseath, Sarah E.; Linares-Orozco, Rubi			A retrospective analysis of NIH-funded digital health research using social media platforms	DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article						Social media platform; research ethics; digital health; big data; Facebook; Twitter; Instagram; Pinterest; IRB	PARTICIPANTS	Objective Social network platforms are increasingly used in digital health research. Our study aimed to 1. qualify and quantify the use of social media platforms in health research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and document changes occurring between 2011 and 2017 and 2. examine whether institutions hosting these studies provided public-facing guidelines on how to conduct ethical social media health research. Methods The NIH RePORTER (Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools) database was searched to identify research utilizing Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, or Twitter. Studies included used social media for observational research, recruitment, intervention delivery or to assess social media as an effective research tool. Abstracts were qualitatively analyzed to describe the population and health topic by year. Websites of organizations receiving funding for this research were searched to identify whether guidance or policy existed. Results Studies (n = 105) were organized by population targeted and health focus. Main "Health" themes were labeled: 1. substance use, 2. disease/diagnosis, 3. psychiatry/mental health, and 4. weight and physical activity. The populations most involved included adolescents and young adults, and men who have sex with men. The number of research studies using social media increased approximately 590% between 2011 and 2017. Studies were linked to 56 organizations of which 21% (n = 12) provided some accessible guidance with 79% (n = 44) offering no guidance specific to social media health research. Conclusions Social media research is conducted with vulnerable populations that are traditionally difficult to reach. There is a compelling need for resources designed to support ethical and responsible social media-enabled research to enable this research to be carried out safely.

J	Rolls, KD; Hansen, M; Jackson, D; Elliott, D				Rolls, Kaye Denise; Hansen, Margaret; Jackson, Debra; Elliott, Doug			Analysis of the Social Network Development of a Virtual Community for Australian Intensive Care Professionals	CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING			English	Article						Intensive care; Mailing list; Nurses; Social media; Social networks; Virtual communities	MAILING LIST; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; NURSES	Social media platforms can create virtual communities, enabling healthcare professionals to network with a broad range of colleagues and facilitate knowledge exchange. In 2003, an Australian state health department established an intensive care mailing list to address the professional isolation experienced by senior intensive care nurses. This article describes the social network created within this virtual community by examining how the membership profile evolved from 2003 to 2009. A retrospective descriptive design was used. The data source was a deidentified member database. Since 2003, 1340 healthcare professionals subscribed to the virtual community with 78% of these (n = 1042) still members at the end of 2009. The membership profile has evolved from a single-state nurse-specific network to an Australia-wide multidisciplinary and multiorganizational intensive care network. The uptake and retention of membership by intensive care clinicians indicated that they appeared to value involvement in this virtual community. For healthcare organizations, a virtual community may be a communications option for minimizing professional and organizational barriers and promoting knowledge flow. Further research is, however, required to demonstrate a link between these broader social networks, enabling the exchange of knowledge and improved patient outcomes.

Methods Using third-generation social network analysis, this study examined the nature and strength of relationships of informal caring networks with formal service providers through individual carer interviews, focus groups of caring networks and outer network interviews. Results Service providers were usually highly valued for providing services, equipment, pain management and personalised care for the dying person plus support and advice to the principal carer about both caring tasks and negotiating the health system. However, formal service providers were positioned as marginal in the caring network. Analysis of the relative density of relationships within networks showed that whereas relationships among family and friends had similar density, relationships between service providers and family or friends were significantly lower. Conclusion The results supported the Circles of Care model and mirror the perspective of formal service providers identified in previous research. The research raises questions about how formal and informal networks might be better integrated to increase their effectiveness for supporting in-home care.

J	Quinlan, E; Robertson, S				Quinlan, Elizabeth; Robertson, Susan			The communicative power of nurse practitioners in multidisciplinary primary healthcare teams	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS			English	Article						Primary care; nurse practitioners; nurse practitioner communication; power; social network analysis; Habermas; lifeworld		Purpose The purpose of the study is to explore the role of the nurse practitioner (NP) in facilitating knowledge exchange within multidisciplinary primary healthcare teams. The rationale for the study is that most knowledge transfer and exchange literature is from a single profession perspective; yet, an increasing number of healthcare practitioners work in the context of multidisciplinary teams. There is little research examining the mechanisms by which knowledge crosses professional and disciplinary boundaries. Data source The study's data source is a survey administered to NPs in urban, rural, and remote primary healthcare teams in Saskatchewan. The mapping techniques of social network analysis are applied to the survey data. Conclusions The study's conclusions concern the structure of the intrateam knowledge-exchange behaviors and, in particular, the role of the NP as knowledge boundary spanner. Implications for practice The study hypothesizes that the hallmark of well-functioning multidisciplinary teams is the effective intrateam knowledge exchange and that Saskatchewan's new NPs bring a boundary-spanning capacity to the knowledge exchange of the province's multidisciplinary primary healthcare teams. The study fills this gap in the conceptual and empirical research within the evolving context of the reorganization of primary health care.

Use of an Internet social network to communicate information on prevention in France	HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL			English	Article						Facebook; general practice; information; prevention; social networks		The popularity of social networks and the huge number of exchanges have made them immensely important for the communication of information. This French study explored prevention in hereditary breast cancer using a social Internet network to communicate information. The principal objective was to inform French women aged from 20 to 50 years, using the social network Facebook, about the warning signs of breast cancer in cases of a predisposition to the disease due to a genetic mutation. The secondary objectives were to inform people about screening. An information page entitled "hereditary breast cancer: and if I was concerned?" was distributed in 3 different ways: from friend to friend, via groups of persons, and by targeted advertising. Four articles and 11 messages were distributed over 27 days. The total number of visits for this period amounted to 1019. A total of 81 percent of the Internauts were women and 55 percent of the visitors were aged between 25 and 44 years. Other information campaigns concerning public health issues could be conducted using this tool. A legal framework is necessary to preserve the quality of the medical information provided. This new means of communication, used for prevention purposes, will add to other frequently used methods of communication.

To determine and describe the features of Indigenous participation in an informal national Indigenous health policy network. Design. A questionnaire was administered during 2003-04. Through a snowball nomination process a total of 227 influential persons were identified. Of these, 173 received surveys of which 44 were returned, a return rate of 25%. Outcome measures. These data were analysed to detect the existence of network groups; measure the degree of group interconnectivity; and measure the characteristics of bonds between influential persons. Demographic information was used to characterise the network and its groups. Results. Indigenous people were integral to the network due to their high representation, their distribution throughout the 16 groups, and the interconnections between the groups. The network was demographically diverse and multiple relational variables were needed to characterise it. Indigenous and non-Indigenous people had strong ties in this network. Conclusion. Social network methods made visible an informal network where Indigenous and non-Indigenous people relate in a complex socio-political environment to influence national Indigenous health policy.

J	Thaikruea, L; Santidherakul, S				Thaikruea, Lakkana; Santidherakul, Sineenart			The public health impact of a new simple practical technique for collection and transfer of toxic jellyfish specimens and for nematocyst identification	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Toxic; Jellyfish; Nematocyst; Specimen; Vacuum techniques	CHIRONEX-FLECKERI; STINGS; ENVENOMATION; AUSTRALIA	Our team aimed to create a new, simple, and inexpensive technique for collecting and transferring of toxic jellyfish specimens and for nematocysts identification. We collected tentacles of Chironex spp., Morbakka spp., and Physalia spp., and transferred them from the beaches by standard and by 'vacuum sticky tape' (VST) techniques. For the VST technique, our team placed the sticky tape on a tentacle and then folded it over to seal the tentacle in the equivalent of a vacuum. We kept the VST in room temperature. For nematocyst identification, we placed the VST on a glass microscope slide and took photographs down the microscope's eye piece using a mobile phone camera. The image quality was as good as when produced by standard techniques. Different classes of toxic jellyfish could be identified. Thus, VST is a potential public health breakthrough because it is practical, durable, inexpensive, allows good discrimination. It enables early warning of danger to health and rapid response via social network.

The communal coping model suggests that families can mitigate shared risk of chronic disease through encouragement of healthful eating, eliciting preventive behaviors. Method: Using network data from 69 Australian families across three ancestry groups (Anglo, Italian, and Asian) with varied family health histories, the present study applied social network analysis to identify patterns of intergenerational encouragement of healthful eating behavior within families, and assess whether patterns varied by family ancestry or disease density. Results: Findings indicated variation in patterns of health encouragement by ancestry such that Asian-Australian families were most distinct from the other ancestry groups. While there was no main effect of familial disease history, it moderated the effect of Italian ancestry on intergenerational encouragement patterns. Discussion: These results provide important context for future family based interventions that leverage normative patterns of intergenerational exchange of encouragement or aim to modify such patterns in an effort to improve family health.

We used a participatory and opportunistic evaluation design, examined documents about KLA activities, conducted three site visits, two key informant and 44 semi-structured interviews and used a force field model to analyse the governance findings. The Lokayukta and his VDH were both proactive and economically independent with an extended social network, technical expertise in both jurisdiction and health care, and were widely perceived to be acting for the common good. They mobilized media and the public about governance issues which were affected by factors at the individual, organizational and societal levels. Their investigations revealed systemic corruption within the public health sector at all levels as well as in public/private collaborations and the political and justice systems. However, wider contextual issues limited their effectiveness in intervening. The departure of the Lokayukta, upon completing his term, was due to a lack of continued political support for controlling corruption. Governance in the health sector is affected by positive and negative forces. A key positive factor was the combined social, cultural and symbolic capital of the two leaders which empowered them to challenge corrupt behaviour and promote good governance. Although change was possible, it was precarious and requires continuous political support to be sustained.

In this paper, we discuss how patients' social interactions develop into social networks based on a network exchange framework and empirically validate the framework in web-based health care community contexts. Objective: This study aims to explore various patterns of information exchange and social support in web-based health care communities and identify factors that affect such patterns. Methods: Using social network analysis and text mining techniques, we empirically validated a network exchange framework on a 10-year data set collected from a popular web-based health community. A reply network was extracted from the data set, and exponential random graph models were used to discover patterns of information exchange and social support from the network. Results: Results showed that reciprocated information exchange was common in web-based health communities. The homophily effect existed in general conversations but was weakened when exchanging knowledge. New members in web-based health communities tended to receive more support. Furthermore, polarized sentiment increases the chances of receiving replies, and optimistic users play an important role in providing social support to the entire community. Conclusions: This study complements the literature on network exchange theories and contributes to a better understanding of social exchange patterns in the web based health care context. Practically, this study can help web-based patients obtain information and social support more effectively.

J	Trail, T; Friedman, E; Rutter, CM; Tanielian, T				Trail, Thomas; Friedman, Esther; Rutter, Carolyn M.; Tanielian, Terri			The Relationship Between Engagement in Online Support Groups and Social Isolation Among Military Caregivers: Longitudinal Questionnaire Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						caregivers; family caregivers; social isolation; loneliness; depression; social support; online intervention; self-help groups; veterans health	LONELINESS; DEPRESSION; IDENTITY; PEOPLE; HEALTH; BELONGINGNESS; CONNECTEDNESS; SCALE	Background: There is a lack of research on the effectiveness of online peer support groups for reducing social isolation and depressive symptoms among caregivers, and previous research has mixed results. Objective: This study aimed to test whether military caregivers who joined a new online peer support community or engaged with an existing online community experienced decreased perceived social isolation and improved depressive symptoms over 6 months. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study of 212 military caregivers who had newly joined an online community and those who were members of other military caregiver groups. Multiple indicators of perceived social isolation and depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Results: Compared with caregivers in the comparison group, caregivers who joined the new group experienced less perceived social isolation at 3 months (eg, number of caregivers in social network [unstandardized regression coefficients] b=0.49, SE 0.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.02), but this effect did not persist at 6 months. Those who engaged more with new or existing groups experienced less perceived social isolation over time (eg, number of caregivers in social network b=0.18, SE 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.27), and this relationship was mediated by increased interactions with other military caregivers (95% CI 0.0046 to 0.0961). Engagement with an online group was not associated with improvements in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Online communities might help reduce social isolation when members engage with the group, but more intensive treatment is needed to improve depressive symptoms.

Collaborative search in electronic health records	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							MYELOABLATIVE ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANTATION; STRUCTURED DATA; SECONDARY USE; INFORMATICS; COMPLICATIONS; TERMINOLOGY; IMPACT	Objective A full-text search engine can be a useful tool for augmenting the reuse value of unstructured narrative data stored in electronic health records (EHR). A prominent barrier to the effective utilization of such tools originates from users' lack of search expertise and/or medical-domain knowledge. To mitigate the issue, the authors experimented with a 'collaborative search' feature through a homegrown EHR search engine that allows users to preserve their search knowledge and share it with others. This feature was inspired by the success of many social information-foraging techniques used on the web that leverage users' collective wisdom to improve the quality and efficiency of information retrieval. Design The authors conducted an empirical evaluation study over a 4-year period. The user sample consisted of 451 academic researchers, medical practitioners, and hospital administrators. The data were analyzed using a social-network analysis to delineate the structure of the user collaboration networks that mediated the diffusion of knowledge of search. Results The users embraced the concept with considerable enthusiasm. About half of the EHR searches processed by the system (0.44 million) were based on stored search knowledge; 0.16 million utilized shared knowledge made available by other users. The social-network analysis results also suggest that the user-collaboration networks engendered by the collaborative search feature played an instrumental role in enabling the transfer of search knowledge across people and domains. Conclusion Applying collaborative search, a social information-foraging technique popularly used on the web, may provide the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of information retrieval in healthcare.

However, some patients also report positive personal changes, posttraumatic growth, related to these potentially traumatic events. This study describes posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, post-migration stressors, and their association with quality of life in an outpatient psychiatric population with a refugee background in Norway. Methods: Fifty five psychiatric outpatients with a refugee background participated in a cross-sectional study using clinical interviews to measure psychopathology (SCID-PTSD, MINI), and four self-report instruments measuring posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, and quality of life (PTGI-SF, IES-R, HSCL-25-depression scale, and WHOQOL-Bref) as well as measures of social integration, social network and employment status. Results: All patients reported some degree of posttraumatic growth, while only 31% reported greater amounts of growth. Eighty percent of the patients had posttraumatic stress symptoms above the cut-off point, and 93% reported clinical levels of depressive symptoms. Quality of life in the four domains of the WHOQOL-Bref levels were low, well below the threshold for the 'life satisfaction' standard proposed by Cummins. A hierarchic regression model including depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, posttraumatic growth, and unemployment explained 56% of the total variance found in the psychological health domain of the WHOQOL-Bref scale. Posttraumatic growth made the strongest contribution to the model, greater than posttraumatic stress symptoms or depressive symptoms. Post-migration stressors like unemployment, weak social network and poor social integration were moderately negatively correlated with posttraumatic growth and quality of life, and positively correlated with psychopathological symptoms. Sixty percent of the outpatients were unemployed. Conclusions: Multi-traumatized refugees in outpatient clinics reported both symptoms of psychopathology and posttraumatic growth after exposure to multiple traumatic events. Symptoms of psychopathology were negatively related to the quality of life, and positively related to post-migration stressors such as unemployment, weak social network and poor social integration. Posttraumatic growth was positively associated with quality of life, and negatively associated with post-migration stressors. Hierarchical regression modeling showed that posttraumatic growth explained more of the variance in quality of life than did posttraumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms or unemployment. It may therefore be necessary to address both positive changes and psychopathological symptoms when assessing and treating multi-traumatized outpatients with a refugee background.

J	Morris, RL; Kennedy, A; Sanders, C				Morris, Rebecca L.; Kennedy, Anne; Sanders, Caroline			Evolving 'self'-management: exploring the role of social network typologies on individual long-term condition management	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						long-term conditions; network typologies; qualitative; self-management; social networks; UK	CHRONIC ILLNESS; SUPPORT; WORK; FAMILY; PEOPLE	Background Whilst there has been a focus on the importance of social support for managing long-term conditions, there has been little specific focus on the characteristics of social networks that shape self-management. Policy emphasis is placed on individual responsibility for self-care, and this influences commissioning of health-care services. Assumptions are often made by policymakers about accessibility and preference for support and the influence of the social context on chronic illness management. Objective To examine the social networks of individuals with long-term conditions and identify how the characteristics of their composition influences support needs. Design, setting and participants Thirty participants completed initial face-to-face in-depth interviews, telephone follow-ups and final face-to-face interviews in the north-west of England. A longitudinal qualitative design was used to elicit the subtle changes in relationships over a year. Findings The findings suggest that the relationships which constitute a social network influence perceived support needs and attitudes to self-management. The amalgamation of relationships was characterized into three network typologies (family focused, friend focused or health-care professional focused) according to which types of relationships were dominant. In the absence of support, accounts highlighted a small number of substitutes who could provide support at times of critical need. Discussion This study challenges the notion of 'self'-management as an individual construct as many of the practices of illness management involved the support and/or negotiation of roles with others. By examining the nuances of relationships, this study has highlighted the tacit boundaries of practical and emotional support provision.

Monitoring for change: the role of family and friends in helping older adults manage personal health information	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						aging; personal health information management; informal caregivers; health information technology; consumer health informatics; public health informatics	ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORDS; PATIENT WORK SYSTEM; CONSUMER HEALTH; HOME TECHNOLOGIES; CARE PARTNERS; CAREGIVERS; CONTEXT; ACCESS; COMMUNICATION; SEEKING	Objective: Although family and friends (FF) often play a significant support role in the health of older adults (OA), we know little about their role in personal health information management (PHIM). To address this gap and inform the design of PHIM tools, we describe the work, needs, and barriers of FF in the context of PHIM for OAs. Methods: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 52 FF identified by OA as being important in their health and PHIM. We analyzed interview transcripts for themes about FF information work, barriers, and support needs. Results: FF play a supportive role in OA health maintenance, medical encounters, decision making, and daily activities. Monitoring, the ongoing process of seeking information related to the OA status, emerged as a key activity comprised of 3 phases: detection, interpretation, and action. Barriers to monitoring included OA choices and constraints, FF constraints, and difficulty with technological tools, resources, health information exchange between providers, social network dynamics, and physical distance. Conclusions: FF frequently monitor for change in OA well-being, seeking up-to-date information to facilitate support of OA PHIM. Health information technology tools designed for FF can support all phases of monitoring by providing: (1) timely and granular levels of access to OA health information as the OA ages; (2) tailored health education for FF that is based on OA clinical data; and (3) networking platforms that integrate delegation, volunteering, and relevant resources, along with tools to facilitate support of OA appointment calendars and medication management. Such tools could reduce the burden of PHIM for OA and their loved ones.

J	Liu, CC; Lu, X				Liu, Chuchu; Lu, Xin			Analyzing hidden populations online: topic, emotion, and social network of HIV-related users in the largest Chinese online community	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Hidden population; Online community; HIV; Social network; Baidu Tieba; China	SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; SUPPORT; FRIENDSHIP; CONTAGION; HEALTH	Background: Traditional survey methods are limited in the study of hidden populations due to the hard to access properties, including lack of a sampiing frame, sensitivity issue, reporting error, small sample size, etc. The rapid increase of online communities, of which members interact with others via the Internet, have generated large amounts of data, offering new opportunities for understanding hidden populations with unprecedented sample sizes and richness of information. In this study, we try to understand the multidimensional characteristics of a hidden population by analyzing the massive data generated in the online community. Methods: By elaborately designing crawlers, we retrieved a complete dataset from the "HIV bar," the largest bar related to HIV on the Baidu Tieba platform, for all records from January 2005 to August 2016. Through natural language processing and social network analysis, we explored the psychology, behavior and demand of online HIV population and examined the network community structure. Results: In HIV communities, the average topic similarity among members is positively correlated to network efficiency (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), indicating that the closer the social distance between members of the community, the more similar their topics. The proportion of negative users in each community is around 60%, weakiy correlated with community size (r = 0.25, p = 0.002). It is found that users suspecting initial HIV infection or first in contact with high-risk behaviors tend to seek help and advice on the social networking platform, rather than immediately going to a hospital for blood tests. Conclusions: Online communities have generated copious amounts of data offering new opportunities for understanding hidden populations with unprecedented sample sizes and richness of information. It is recommended that support through online services for HIV/AIDS consultation and diagnosis be improved to avoid privacy concerns and social discrimination in China.

Cancer-related fatigue and its determinants in a cohort of women with breast cancer: the DAMA Cohort	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Fatigue-related cancer; Breast cancer; Quality of life; Social network; Social support	PILOT TRIAL; SURVIVORS; THERAPY; PROGRAM	Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prolonged discomforts suffered by people who have had cancer. Seventy-eight to ninety-six percent of cancer patients experience fatigue, especially while undergoing treatment. CRF is related to insomnia, anxiety, depression, and also varies depending on age. However, little is known about the factors contributing to CRF and better understanding of determinants of CRF makes it easier to identify early patients at risk and in designing intervention planning. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of precipitating factors (diagnosis of breast cancer and other clinical aspects) and perpetuating factors (social network, quality of life, mental disorders) on the presence of chronic fatigue in women from our cultural context, by social class each other determinants. Methods It was carried out a mixed cohort study (prospective and retrospective) using a convenience sample of women diagnosed with breast cancer. The information sources were data from the Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaire and hospital medical records. The dependent variable was fatigue and the independent variables were age, social class, time since diagnoses, cohabitation, comorbidity, relapse, body mass index, mental health (anxiety and depression), social network, social support, and quality of life. Results Seventy-two percent of the women in the DAMA cohort reported moderate to severe fatigue. Risk of suffering from severe fatigue was greatest among individuals with low social class, those aged under 50 years, those with chronic disorders who had relapsed, and those with symptoms of anxiety and depression. In our study, CRF did not appear to be related to the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, or to the time since diagnosis. Conclusions CRF is an element that the professionals responsible for the control and monitoring of women should take into account as another element to be taken into consideration.

Finney			Health Information Brokers in the General Population: An Analysis of the Health Information National Trends Survey 2013-2014	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						health information seeking; peer communication; social network; patient self-management; health care decision-making	SEEKING; BEHAVIOR; SEEKERS; ONLINE	Background: Health information exchanged between friends or family members can influence decision making, both for routine health questions and for serious health issues. A health information broker is a person to whom friends and family turn for advice or information on health-related topics. Characteristics and online behaviors of health information brokers have not previously been studied in a national population. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine sociodemographic characteristics, health information seeking behaviors, and other online behaviors among health information brokers. Methods: Data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (2013-2014; n=3142) were used to compare brokers with nonbrokers. Modified Poisson regression was used to examine the relationship between broker status and sociodemographics and online information seeking. Results: Over half (54.8%) of the respondents were consulted by family or friends for advice or information on health topics (ie, they acted as health information brokers). Brokers represented 54.1% of respondents earning <$20,000 yearly and 56.5% of respondents born outside the United States. Women were more likely to be brokers (PR 1.34, 95% CI 1.23-1.47) as were those with education past high school (PR 1.42, CI 1.22-1.65). People aged >= 75 were less likely to be brokers as compared to respondents aged 35-49 (PR 0.81, CI 0.67-0.99). Brokers used the Internet more frequently for a variety of online behaviors such as seeking health information, creating and sharing online content, and downloading health information onto a mobile device; and also reported greater confidence in obtaining health information online. Conclusions: More than 50% of adults who responded to this national survey, including those with low income and those born abroad, were providing health information or advice to friends and family. These individuals may prove to be effective targets for initiatives supporting patient engagement and disease management, and may also be well-positioned within their respective social networks to propagate health messages.

Online Social Networks and Smoking Cessation: A Scientific Research Agenda	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Smoking cessation; social support; social networks; addiction; treatment; tobacco	RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; INTERNET; SUPPORT; HEALTH; SPREAD; INTERVENTIONS; COMMUNITY; ABSTINENCE; BEHAVIOR; PHONE	Background: Smoking remains one of the most pressing public health problems in the United States and internationally. The concurrent evolution of the Internet, social network science, and online communities offers a potential target for high-yield interventions capable of shifting population-level smoking rates and substantially improving public health. Objective: Our objective was to convene leading practitioners in relevant disciplines to develop the core of a strategic research agenda on online social networks and their use for smoking cessation, with implications for other health behaviors. Methods: We conducted a 100-person, 2-day, multidisciplinary workshop in Washington, DC, USA. Participants worked in small groups to formulate research questions that could move the field forward. Discussions and resulting questions were synthesized by the workshop planning committee. Results: We considered 34 questions in four categories (advancing theory, understanding fundamental mechanisms, intervention approaches, and evaluation) to be the most pressing. Conclusions: Online social networks might facilitate smoking cessation in several ways. Identifying new theories, translating these into functional interventions, and evaluating the results will require a concerted transdisciplinary effort. This report presents a series of research questions to assist researchers, developers, and funders in the process of efficiently moving this field forward.

Research has identified the participation of certain network members who assume leadership roles by providing support, advice, and direction to other members. In the literature, these individuals have been variously defined as key players, posters, active users, or caretakers. Despite their identification, very little research has been conducted on the contributions or demographic characteristics of this population. For this study, we collectively categorized key players, posters, active users, and caretakers as superusers. Objectives: To analyze data from two large but distinct Web-assisted tobacco interventions (WATI) to help gain insight into superuser demographic characteristics and how they use social networks. Methods: We extracted cross-sectional data sets containing posting behaviors and demographic characteristics from a free, publicly funded program (the Canadian Cancer Society's Smokers' Helpline Online: SHO), and a free, privately run program (StopSmokingCenter.net: SSC). Results: Within the reporting period (SHO: June 26, 2008 to October 12, 2010; SSC: May 17, 2007 to October 12, 2010), 21,128 individuals registered for the SHO and 11,418 registered for the SSC. Within the same period, 1670 (7.90%) registrants made at least one post in the SHO social network, and 1627 (14.25%) registrants made at least one post in the SSC social network. SHO and SSC superusers accounted for 0.4% (n = 95) and 1.1% (n = 124) of all registrants, and 5.7% (95/1670) and 7.62% (124/1627) of all social network participants, and contributed to 34.78% (29,422/84,599) and 46.22% (61,820/133,753) of social network content, respectively. Despite vast differences in promotion and group management rules, and contrary to the beliefs of group moderators, there were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics between the two superuser groups. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study that compared demographic characteristics and posting behavior from two separate eHealth social networks. Despite vast differences in promotional efforts and management styles, both WATI attracted superusers with similar characteristics. As superusers drive network traffic, organizations promoting or supporting WATI should dedicate resources to encourage superuser participation. Further research regarding member dynamics and optimization of social networks for health care purposes is required.

Public health measures that were effective in previous infection outbreaks (eg, wearing a face mask, quarantining) were implemented in this outbreak. Available multidimensional social network data that take advantage of the recent rapid development of information and communication technologies allow for an exploration of disease spread and control via a modernized epidemiological approach. By using spatiotemporal data and real-time information, we can provide more accurate estimates of disease spread patterns related to human activities and enable more efficient responses to the outbreak. Two real cases during the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the application of emerging technologies and digital data in monitoring human movements related to disease spread. Although the ethical issues related to using digital epidemiology are still under debate, the cases reported in this article may enable the identification of more effective public health measures, as well as future applications of such digitally directed epidemiological approaches in controlling infectious disease outbreaks, which offer an alternative and modern outlook on addressing the long-standing challenges in population health.

Data of year 2011 annual assessment in 1003 older men and women from the Lc65+ cohort study were used. Overall QoL was self-rated as 'excellent,' 'very good,' 'good,' 'fair,' or 'poor.' To identify significant health (self-rated health, SF-12v2 physical and mental health), economic (financial situation), and social (living with others, being socially supported, emotional support, group activities participation) determinants of QoL, a cut-off was set at three different positions to define favorable QoL on the 'excellent' to 'poor' spectrum: at least 'good' (model 1); at least 'very good' (model 2); and 'excellent' only (model 3). In all three models, bivariable analyses indicated significant associations between QoL and at least one variable from each health, economic, and social dimension. In multivariable analyses, only health-related variables remained significantly associated with QoL in model 1. Model 3 additionally retained financial situation. In model 2, QoL was positively associated with physical health [odds ratio (OR) 1.10, p < 0.001], mental health (OR 1.12, p < 0.001), self-rated health (OR 2.43, p < 0.001), group activities participation (OR 1.43, p = 0.037), being socially supported (OR 1.58, p = 0.024), and not reporting financial difficulties (OR 1.76; p = 0.036). Using different cut-offs to defining favorable QoL results in important changes in the number and type of significant health, economic and social determinants. A cut-off between 'good' and 'very good' appears to best reflect the multidimensional nature of QoL.

Exploring the Networking of Academic Health Science Leaders: How and Why Do They Do It?	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							EDUCATION; STRATEGIES; COMPLEXITY; PICTURES; TIES	Purpose Networking is essential to leadership effectiveness in the business context. Yet little is known about leadership networking within the academic health science context. If we are going to train academic leaders, we must first understand the relational, network-based activities of their work. The purpose of this study was to explore how academic health science leaders engage in networking activities in the academic health science context. Method A constructivist grounded theory approach guided our study. The authors interviewed 24 academic health science leaders who were enrolled in the New and Evolving Academic Leadership program at the University of Toronto and used social network mapping as an elicitation method. Interviews, which were conducted between September 2014 and June 2015, explored participants' networks and networking activities. Constant comparative analysis was used to analyze the interviews, with attention paid to identifying key networking activities. Results Academic health science leaders were found to engage in 4 types of networking activities: role bound, project based, goal/vision informed, and opportunity driven. These 4 types were influenced by participants' conception of their role and their perceived leadership work context, which in turn influenced their sense of agency. Conclusions The networking activities identified in this study of academic health science leaders resonate with effective networking activities found in other fields. The findings highlight that these activities can be facilitated by focusing on leaders' perceptions about role and work context. Leadership development should thus attend to these perceptions to encourage effective networking skills.

In this paper, we applied the mapping change method, originally used in large networks, to small and medium ones, and used the Tabu search scheme instead of simulated annealing . Finally, to highlight the significant changes over time of keywords networks, an alluvial diagram is used to show the significance clusterings through the sub periods studied. The work reports on the most relevant authors on the subject and the most widely used mathematical models applied to solve the problem. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fukkink, RG; van Verseveld, M				Fukkink, Ruben G.; van Verseveld, Marloes			Inclusive early childhood education and care: a longitudinal study into the growth of interprofessional collaboration	JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE			English	Article						Quantitative method; questionnaire designs; interprofessional collaboration; collaborative competence; co-operation; team-based practice	HEALTH-CARE; NETWORK ANALYSIS; MENTAL-HEALTH; INTEGRATION; PERSPECTIVE; GOVERNANCE	Inclusive early childhood education and care (ECEC) requires interprofessional collaboration between professionals with diverse professional backgrounds. Following developments in human services, there is a growing interest in the role of interprofessional teams in community-based settings for young children. In a three-year longitudinal study, we investigated interprofessional collaboration (IPC) between staff from childcare, education and youth care. At the individual level, a survey was used for the analysis of IPC competences. At the network level, we investigated professional relationships between individuals using social network analysis. Results of a multilevel mixed linear model showed an increase in interdependence and reflection on process of individual staff, followed by the progressive development of perceived team performance. Smaller networks with higher density and professionals' centrality predicted more positive perceptions of inclusive ECEC. We discuss our findings in the context of growing interest in interprofessional teams in ECEC.

Socialising Health Burden Through Different Network Topologies: A Simulation Study	INTEGRATING AND CONNECTING CARE	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	25th Australian National Health Informatics Conference (HIC)	AUG 06-09, 2017	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA			Guardian Angel; social network; agent-based model; emotional contagion; NetLogo	PEER SUPPORT; CONTAGION	An aging population and the expectation of premium quality health services combined with the increasing economic burden of the healthcare system requires a paradigm shift toward patient oriented healthcare. The guardian angel theory described by Szolovits [1] explores the notion of enlisting patients as primary providers of information and motivation to patients with similar clinical history through social connections. In this study, an agent based model was developed to simulate to explore how individuals are affected through their levels of intrinsic positivity. Ring, point-to-point (paired buddy), and random networks were modelled, with individuals able to send messages to each other given their levels of variables positivity and motivation. Of the 3 modelled networks it is apparent that the ring network provides the most equal, collective improvement in positivity and motivation for all users.

J	Prodinger, B; Taylor, P				Prodinger, Birgit; Taylor, Paul			Improving quality of care through patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs): expert interviews using the NHS PROMs Programme and the Swedish quality registers for knee and hip arthroplasty as examples	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Health information system evaluation; Quality registry; Oxford hip score; Oxford knee score; EQ-5D; Expert interviews; Social network analysis; Directive content analysis	HEALTH INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; MEASURES WORKING GROUP; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY; REGISTRIES	Background: Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been integrated in national quality registries or specific national monitoring initiatives to inform the improvement of quality of care on a national scale. However there are many unanswered questions, such as: how these systems are set up, whether they lead to improved quality of care, which stakeholders use the information once it is available. The aim of this study was to examine supporting and hindering factors relevant to integrating patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in selected health information systems (HIS) tailored toward improving quality of care across the entire health system. Methods: First, a systematic search and review was conducted to outline previously identified factors relevant to the integration of PROMs in the selected HIS. A social network analysis was performed to identify networks of experts in these systems. Second, expert interviews were conducted to discuss and elaborate on the identified factors. Directive content analysis was applied using a HIS Evaluation Framework as the frame of reference. This framework is structured into four components: Organization, Human, Technology, and Net benefits. Results: The literature review revealed 37 papers for the NHS PROMs Programme and 26 papers for the SHPR and SKAR: Five networks of researchers were identified for the NHS PROMs Programme and 1 for the SHPR and SKAR. Seven experts related to the NHS PROMs Programme and 3 experts related to the SKAR and SHPR participated in the study. The main themes which revealed in relation to Organization were Governance and Capacity building; to Human: Reporting and Stakeholder Engagement; to Technology: the Selection and Collection of PROMs and Data linkage. In relation to Net benefits, system-specific considerations are presented. Conclusion: Both examples succeeded in integrating PROMs into HIS on a national scale. The lack of an established standard on what change PROMs should be achieved by an intervention limits their usefulness for monitoring quality of care. Whether the PROMs data collected within these systems can be used in routine clinical practice is considered a challenge in both countries.

Structural integration and performance of inter-sectoral public health-related policy networks: An analysis across policy phases	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Public health-related policy networks; Inter-sectoral policy networks; Network integration; Environmental determinants of health; Network performance; Social network analysis	GOVERNANCE NETWORKS; FRAMEWORK; OUTCOMES; IMPACT	Background: Inter-sectoral policy networks may be effective in addressing environmental determinants of health with interventions. However, contradictory results are reported on relations between structural network characteristics (i.e., composition and integration) and network performance, such as addressing environmental determinants of health. This study examines these relations in different phases of the policy process. Methods: A multiple-case study was performed on four public health-related policy networks. Using a snowball method among network actors, overall and sub-networks per policy phase were identified and the policy sector of each actor was assigned. To operationalise the outcome variable, interventions were classified by the proportion of environmental determinants they addressed. Results: In the overall networks, no relation was found between structural network characteristics and network performance. In most effective cases, the policy development sub-networks were characterised by integration with less interrelations between actors (low cohesion), more equally distributed distances between the actors (low closeness centralisation), and horizontal integration in inter-sectoral cliques. The most effective case had non-public health central actors with less connections in all sub-networks. Conclusion: The results suggest that, to address environmental determinants of health, sub-networks should be inter-sectorally composed in the policy development rather than in the intervention development and implementation phases, and that policy development actors should have the opportunity to connect with other actors, without strong direction from a central actor.

One such means can include building upon professional advice networks to more efficiently introduce, scale up, or change programmes and healthcare provider practices. This cross-sectional, mixed-methods, observational study compared professional advice networks of healthcare workers in eight primary healthcare units across four regions of Ethiopia. Primary healthcare units include a health centre and typically five satellite health posts.MethodsOne hundred sixty staff at eight primary healthcare units were interviewed using a structured tool. Quantitative data captured the frequency of healthcare worker advice seeking and giving on providing antenatal, childbirth, postnatal and newborn care. Network and actor-level metrics were calculated including density (ratio of ties between actors to all possible ties), centrality (number of ties incident to an actor), distance (average number of steps between actors) and size (number of actors within the network). Following quantitative network analyses, 20 qualitative interviews were conducted with network study participants from four primary healthcare units. Qualitative interviews aimed to interpret and explain network properties observed. Data were entered, analysed or visualised using Excel 6.0, UCINET 6.0, Netdraw, Adobe InDesign and MaxQDA10 software packages.ResultsThe following average network level metrics were observed: density .26 (SD.11), degree centrality .45 (SD.08), distance 1.94 (SD.26), number of ties 95.63 (SD 35.46), size of network 20.25 (SD 3.65). Advice networks for antenatal or maternity care were more utilised than advice networks for post-natal or newborn care. Advice networks were typically limited to primary healthcare unit staff, but not necessarily to supervisors. In seeking advice, a colleague's level of training and knowledge were valued over experience. Advice exchange primarily took place in person or over the phone rather than over email or online fora. There were few barriers to seeking advice.ConclusionInformal, inter-and intra-cadre advice networks existed. Fellow primary healthcare unit staff were preferred, particularly midwives, but networks were not limited to the primary healthcare unit. Additional research is needed to associate network properties with outcomes and pilot network interventions with central actors.

J	Wilkinson, J; Goff, M; Rusoja, E; Hanson, C; Swanson, RC				Wilkinson, Jessica; Goff, Morgan; Rusoja, Evan; Hanson, Carl; Swanson, Robert Chad			The application of systems thinking concepts, methods, and tools to global health practices: An analysis of case studies	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						complexity; global health; systems thinking	COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS; DECISION-MAKING; CARE; SERVICES; SCIENCE; IMPACT; IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; PATHWAYS	ObjectivesThis review of systems thinking (ST) case studies seeks to compile and analyse cases from ST literature and provide practitioners with a reference for ST in health practice. Particular attention was given to (1) reviewing the frequency and use of key ST terms, methods, and tools in the context of health, and (2) extracting and analysing longitudinal themes across cases. MethodsA systematic search of databases was conducted, and a total of 36 case studies were identified. A combination of integrative and inductive qualitative approaches to analysis was used. ResultsMost cases identified took place in high-income countries and applied ST retrospectively. The most commonly used ST terms were agent/stakeholder/actor (n=29), interdependent/interconnected (n=28), emergence (n=26), and adaptability/adaptation (n=26). Common ST methods and tools were largely underutilized. Social network analysis was the most commonly used method (n=4), and innovation or change management history was the most frequently used tool (n=11). Four overarching themes were identified; the importance of the interdependent and interconnected nature of a health system, characteristics of leaders in a complex adaptive system, the benefits of using ST, and barriers to implementing ST. ConclusionsThis review revealed that while much has been written about the potential benefits of applying ST to health, it has yet to completely transition from theory to practice. There is however evidence of the practical use of an ST lens as well as specific methods and tools. With clear examples of ST applications, the global health community will be better equipped to understand and address key health challenges.

Coordination of multiple specialties is critical for patients with complex health conditions, and requires interprofessional and intraprofessional communication. We examined a communication network of 71 health professionals in four professional roles: physician, nurse, health management, and support personnel (dietitian, pharmacist, or social worker), or other health professionals (including physical, respiratory, and occupational therapists, and medical students) working in a burn unit. Data for this cross-sectional study were collected by surveying members of a healthcare team. Ties were defined by asking team members whom they discussed patient care matters with on the shift. We built an exponential random graph model to determine: (1) does professional role influence the likelihood of a tie; (2) are ties more likely between team members from different professions compared to between team members from the same profession; and (3) which professions are more likely to form interprofessional ties. Health management and support personnel ties were 94% interprofessional while ties among nurses were 60% interprofessional. Nurses and other health professionals were significantly less likely than physicians to form ties. Nurses were 1.64 times more likely to communicate with nurses than non-nurses (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.01-2.66); there was no significant role homophily for physicians, other health professionals, or health management and support personnel. Understanding communication networks in healthcare teams is an early step in understanding how teams work together to provide care; future work should evaluate the types and quality of interactions between members of interprofessional healthcare teams.

However, data is scarce and finding appropriate sampling strategies to obtain representative results is challenging. In order to increase survey response in hard-to-reach populations, new methods were developed. One of them is respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a network sampling technique. We aimed to assess if respondent-driven sampling is a better approach to recruit Syrian migrants for health research than classical random sampling via the population registry.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in Munich between April and June 2017 inviting adults (18+ years) born in Syria to answer an online questionnaire asking for sociodemographic and health-related information. Recruitment of participants was done using a) random sampling via the population registry (PR) and b) RDS. The two study populations recruited via respondent-driven sampling and the population registry were compared to a sample drawn from the population registry with respect to gender and citizenship. In addition, the two study populations were compared to each other regarding self-reported health status, healthcare utilisation, lifestyle factors, social network size, and acculturation.ResultsOf 374 persons randomly drawn from the population registry, 49 individuals answered the questionnaire completely (response: 13.1%) while via RDS 195 participants were recruited by 16 seeds. More persons possessed German citizenship in the total sample (20.5, 95% CI: 16.6 to 24.8%) and in the PR study population (28.6, 95% CI: 16.6 to 43.3%) than in the study population (0.5, 95% CI: 0.1 to 1.5%). Participants recruited via the population registry were older, smoked less, reported more often to hold a university degree, and indicated a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, more frequent healthcare utilisation, higher scores of acculturation as well as a larger social network compared to the study population obtained via RDS.ConclusionsResponse was very low in the PR sample. The number of participants recruited via RDS was larger and led to a study population with substantially different characteristics. Our study thus indicates that RDS is a useful way to gain access to specific subgroups that are hard to reach via traditional random sampling.

Using network projections to explore co-incidence and context in large clinical datasets: Application to homelessness among US Veterans	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Homelessness; US Veterans; Social network analysis; Information foraging; Data exploration; ICD9 codes	HEALTH; PATTERNS	Introduction: Network projections of data can provide an efficient format for data exploration of coincidence in large clinical datasets. We present and explore the utility of a network projection approach to finding patterns in health care data that could be exploited to prevent homelessness among U.S. Veterans. Method: We divided Veteran ICD-9-CM (ICD9) data into two time periods (0-59 and 60-364 days prior to the first evidence of homelessness) and then used Pajek social network analysis software to visualize these data as three different networks. A multi-relational network simultaneously displayed the magnitude of ties between the most frequent ICD9 pairings. A new association network visualized ICD9 pairings that greatly increased or decreased. A signed, subtraction network visualized the presence, absence, and magnitude difference between ICD9 associations by time period. Result: A cohort of 9468 U.S. Veterans was identified as having administrative evidence of homelessness and visits in both time periods. They were seen in 222,599 outpatient visits that generated 484,339 ICD9 codes (average of 11.4 (range 1-23) visits and 2.2 (range 1-60) ICD9 codes per visit). Using the three network projection methods, we were able to show distinct differences in the pattern of co-morbidities in the two time periods. In the more distant time period preceding homelessness, the network was dominated by routine health maintenance visits and physical ailment diagnoses. In the 59 days immediately prior to the homelessness identification, alcohol related diagnoses along with economic circumstances such as unemployment, legal circumstances, along with housing instability were noted. Conclusion: Network visualizations of large clinical datasets traditionally treated as tabular and difficult to manipulate reveal rich, previously hidden connections between data variables related to homelessness. A key feature is the ability to visualize changes in variables with temporality and in proximity to the event of interest. These visualizations lend support to cognitive tasks such as exploration of large clinical datasets as a prelude to hypothesis generation. Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Pettey, Warren B.

Social network analysis (SNA) has been used successfully to assess and strengthen participation in health promotion programs. We applied SNA methods to investigate whether interpersonal relationships among residents within buildings influenced their participation in CHAP.MethodsOur aim was to examine relational dynamics in two social housing buildings in Quebec with low and high CHAP attendance rates, respectively. We used sociometric questionnaires and network analysis for the quantitative phase of the study, supplemented by a phase of qualitative interviews. All residents of both buildings were eligible for the sociometric questionnaire. Respondents for the qualitative interviews were purposively selected to represent the different attendance situations following the principle of content saturation.ResultsIn total, 69 residents participated in the study, 37 through sociometric questionnaires and 32 in qualitative interviews. Of the latter, 10 attended almost all CHAP sessions, 10 attended once, and 12 attended none. Results of the quantitative analysis phase identified well-known and appreciated local leaders. In Building 1, which had a high attendance rate (34.3%), there was a main leader (in-degree or 'named by others' frequency 23.2%) who had attended all CHAP sessions. In Building 2, which had a low attendance rate (23.9%), none of the leaders had attended CHAP sessions. Results of the qualitative analysis phase showed that residents who did not attend CHAP sessions (or other activities in the building) generally preferred to avoid conflicts, vindictiveness, and gossip and did not want to get involved in clans and politics within their building.ConclusionWe identified four potential strategies to increase attendance at CHAP sessions by residents of subsidized housing for older adults: strengthen confidentiality for those attending the sessions; use community peer networks to enhance recruitment; pair attendees to increase the likelihood of participation; and intervene through opinion leaders or bridging individuals.

A Multirelational Social Network Analysis of an Online Health Community for Smoking Cessation	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social networks; smoking cessation; community networks	SUPPORT GROUP; VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES; INTERNET; COMMUNICATION; BEHAVIOR; FORUM	Background: Online health communities (OHCs) provide a convenient and commonly used way for people to connect around shared health experiences, exchange information, and receive social support. Users often interact with peers via multiple communication methods, forming a multirelational social network. Use of OHCs is common among smokers, but to date, there have been no studies on users' online interactions via different means of online communications and how such interactions are related to smoking cessation. Such information can be retrieved in multirelational social networks and could be useful in the design and management of OHCs. Objective: To examine the social network structure of an OHC for smoking cessation using a multirelational approach, and to explore links between subnetwork position (ie, centrality) and smoking abstinence. Methods: We used NetworkX to construct 4 subnetworks based on users' interactions via blogs, group discussions, message boards, and private messages. We illustrated topological properties of each subnetwork, including its degree distribution, density, and connectedness, and compared similarities among these subnetworks by correlating node centrality and measuring edge overlap. We also investigated coevolution dynamics of this multirelational network by analyzing tie formation sequences across subnetworks. In a subset of users who participated in a randomized, smoking cessation treatment trial, we conducted user profiling based on users' centralities in the 4 subnetworks and identified user groups using clustering techniques. We further examined 30-day smoking abstinence at 3 months postenrollment in relation to users' centralities in the 4 subnetworks. Results: The 4 subnetworks have different topological characteristics, with message board having the most nodes (36,536) and group discussion having the highest network density (4.35x10(-3)). Blog and message board subnetworks had the most similar structures with an in-degree correlation of .45, out-degree correlation of .55, and Jaccard coefficient of .23 for edge overlap. A new tie in the group discussion subnetwork had the lowest probability of triggering subsequent ties among the same two users in other subnetworks: 6.33% (54,142/855,893) for 2-tie sequences and 2.13% (18,207/855,893) for 3-tie sequences. Users' centralities varied across the 4 subnetworks. Among a subset of users enrolled in a randomized trial, those with higher centralities across subnetworks generally had higher abstinence rates, although high centrality in the group discussion subnetwork was not associated with higher abstinence rates. Conclusions: A multirelational approach revealed insights that could not be obtained by analyzing the aggregated network alone, such as the ineffectiveness of group discussions in triggering social ties of other types, the advantage of blogs, message boards, and private messages in leading to subsequent social ties of other types, and the weak connection between one's centrality in the group discussion subnetwork and smoking abstinence. These insights have implications for the design and management of online social networks for smoking cessation.

Methods: We searched all the articles with the keyword "health management" in the period 1999-2011 in Web of Knowledge, then 3067 articles were found. Methods such as Social network analysis (SNA), co-authorship, co-word analysis were used in this study. Results: Analysis of the past 13 years of research in the field of health management indicates that, whether the production of scientific research, or authors, institutions and scientific research collaboration at the national level, collaboration behavior has been growing steadily across all collaboration types. However, the international scientific research cooperation about health management study between countries needs to be further encouraged. 17 researchers can be seen as the academic leaders in this field. 37 research institutions play a vital role in the information dissemination and resources control in health management. The component analysis found that 22 research groups can be regarded as the backbone in this field. The 8 institution groups consisting of 33 institutions form the core of this field. USA, UK and Australia lie in the center by cohesive subgroup analysis; Based on keywords analysis, 44 keywords with high frequency such as care, disease, system and model were involved in the health management field. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that although it is growing steadily, collaboration behavior about health management study needs to be enhanced, especially between different institutions or countries/regions, which would promote the progress and internationalization of health management. Besides, researchers should pay attention to the cooperation of representative scholars and institutions, as well as the hot areas of research, because their experience would help us promote the research development of our nation.

S.			The influence of social networking sites on health behavior change: a systematic review and meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Review						Social Networking Site; Social Network; Social Media; Consumer Health; Behavior Change	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY INTERVENTION; WEIGHT-LOSS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; ONLINE; MEDIA; INTERNET; SPREAD; FACEBOOK; SMOKING; COMMUNICATION	Objective Our aim was to evaluate the use and effectiveness of interventions using social networking sites (SNSs) to change health behaviors. Materials and methods Five databases were scanned using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on patients/consumers, involved an SNS intervention, had an outcome related to health behavior change, and were prospective. Studies were screened by independent investigators, and assessed using Cochrane's 'risk of bias' tool. Randomized controlled trials were pooled in a meta-analysis. Results The database search retrieved 4656 citations; 12 studies (7411 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Facebook was the most utilized SNS, followed by health-specific SNSs, and Twitter. Eight randomized controlled trials were combined in a meta-analysis. A positive effect of SNS interventions on health behavior outcomes was found (Hedges' g 0.24; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.43). There was considerable heterogeneity (I-2 = 84.0%; T-2 = 0.058) and no evidence of publication bias. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of SNS interventions in changing health-related behaviors. Most studies evaluated multi-component interventions, posing problems in isolating the specific effect of the SNS. Health behavior change theories were seldom mentioned in the included articles, but two particularly innovative studies used 'network alteration', showing a positive effect. Overall, SNS interventions appeared to be effective in promoting changes in health-related behaviors, and further research regarding the application of these promising tools is warranted. Conclusions Our study showed a positive effect of SNS interventions on health behavior-related outcomes, but there was considerable heterogeneity.

HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Access to health care; Dakar; equity; malaria; multilevel analysis; neighbourhood; poverty; social network	MALARIA TRANSMISSION; CONTEXTUAL DETERMINANTS; MULTILEVEL MODELS; MEDICAL-CARE; SERVICES; QUALITY; ACCESS; DAKAR; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INEQUALITY	Urban malaria is considered a major public health problem in Africa. The malaria vector is well adapted in urban settings and autochthonous malaria has increased. Antimalarial treatments prescribed presumptively or after rapid diagnostic tests are also highly used in urban settings. Furthermore, health care strategies for urban malaria must comply with heterogeneous neighbourhood ecosystems where health-related risks and opportunities are spatially varied. This article aims to assess the capacity of the urban living environment to mitigate or increase individual or household vulnerabilities that influence the use of health services. The data are drawn from a survey on urban malaria conducted between 2008 and 2009. The study sample was selected using a two-stage randomized sampling. The questionnaire survey covered 2952 households that reported a case of fever episode in children below 10 years during the month before the survey. Self-medication is a widespread practice for children, particularly among the poorest households in Dakar. For rich households, self-medication for children is more a transitional practice enabling families to avoid opportunity costs related to visits to health facilities. For the poorest, it is a forced choice and often the only treatment option. However, the poor that live in well-equipped neighbourhoods inhabited by wealthy residents tend to behave as their rich neighbours. They grasp the opportunities provided by the area and adjust their behaviours accordingly. Though health care for children is strongly influenced by household socio-economic characteristics, neighbourhood resources (facilities and social networks) will promote health care among the poorest and reduce access inequalities. Without being a key factor, the neighbourhood of residence-when it provides resources-may be of some help to overcome the financial hurdle.

Objective: This study aimed to explore discussions on the popular anonymous social network Yik Yak related to social and mental health messaging behaviors among college students, including cyberbullying, to provide insights into mental health behaviors on college campuses. Methods: From April 6, 2016, to May 7, 2016, we collected anonymous conversations posted on Yik Yak at 19 universities in 4 different states and performed statistical analyses and text classification experiments on a subset of these messages. Results: We found that prosocial messages were 5.23 times more prevalent than bullying messages. The frequency of cyberbullying messages was positively associated with messages seeking emotional help. We found significant geographic variation in the frequency of messages offering supportive vs bullying messages. Across campuses, bullying and political discussions were positively associated. We also achieved a balanced accuracy of over 0.75 for most messaging behaviors and topics with a support vector machine classifier. Conclusions: Our results show that messages containing data about students' mental health-related attitudes and behaviors are prevalent on anonymous social networks, suggesting that these data can be mined for real-time analysis. This information can be used in education and health care services to better engage with students, provide insight into conversations that lead to cyberbullying, and reach out to students who need support.

Longitudinal analysis of large social networks: Estimating the effect of health traits on changes in friendship ties	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						dyadic independence; hierarchical model; homophily on health traits; longitudinal; social network	TRIALS	We develop novel mixed effects models to examine the role of health traits on the status of peoples' close friendship nominations in the Framingham Heart Study. The health traits considered are both mutable (body mass index (BMI), smoking, blood pressure, body proportion, muscularity, and depression) and, for comparison, basically immutable (height, birth order, personality type, only child, and handedness); and the traits have varying degrees of observability. We test the hypotheses that existing ties (i.e. close friendship nominations) are more likely to dissolve between people with dissimilar (mutable and observable) health traits whereas new ties are more likely to form between those with similar (mutable and observable) traits while controlling for persons' age, gender, geographic separation, and education. The mixed effects models contain random effects for both the nominator (ego) and nominated (alter) persons in a tie to account for the fact that people were involved in multiple relationships and contributed observations at multiple exams. Results for BMI support the hypotheses that people of similar BMI are less likely to dissolve existing ties and more likely to form ties, while smoker to non-smoker ties were the least likely to dissolve and smoker to smoker ties were the most likely to form. We also validated previously known findings regarding homophily on age and gender, and found evidence that homophily also depends upon geographic separation.

Social capital and maternal and child health services uptake in low- and middle-income countries: mixed methods systematic review	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Review						Maternal and child health services; Social capital; Social network; LMICs	MENTAL-HEALTH; BIRTH-WEIGHT; INTERVENTIONS; COMMUNITIES; SUPPORT; INEQUALITY; TRUST; INDIA; RISK; SIDE	Background Social capital has become an important concept in the field of public health, and is associated with improved health services uptake. This study aimed to systematically review the available literature on the role of social capital on the utilization of maternal and child health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods Mixed-methods research review and synthesis using three databases PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct for peer-reviewed literature and Google Scholar and Google search engines for gray literature were performed. Both quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in LMICs, published in English and in grey literature were considered. Prior to inclusion in the review methodological quality was assessed using a standardized critical appraisal instrument. Results A total of 1,545 studies were identified, of which 13 records were included after exclusions of studies due to duplicates, reading titles, abstracts, and full-text reviews. Of these eligible studies, six studies were included for quantitative synthesis, and seven were included for qualitative synthesis. Of the six quantitative studies, five of them addressed the association between social capital and health facility delivery. Women who lived in communities with higher membership in groups that helps to form intergroup bridging ties had higher odds of using antenatal care services. Synthesized qualitative findings revealed that women received some form of emotional, informational, and instrumental support from their network members. Receiving health information from trusted people and socio-cultural factors influenced the use of maternal and child health services. Conclusions Social capital has a great contribution to improve maternal and child health services. Countries aiming at improving maternal and child health services can be benefited from adapting existing context-specific social networks in the community. This review identified limited available evidence examining the role of social capital on maternal and child health services uptake and future studies may be required for an in-depth understanding of how social capital could improve maternal and child health services.

The Use of Social Networking Sites for Public Health Practice and Research: A Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Review						public health informatics; public health; social network; health communication	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; YOUNG-ADULTS; ALCOHOL REFERENCES; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; HIV PREVENTION; SEXUAL RISK; WEB 2.0; ONLINE; INTERNET; MEDIA	Background: Social networking sites (SNSs) have the potential to increase the reach and efficiency of essential public health services, such as surveillance, research, and communication. Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the use of SNSs for public health research and practice and to identify existing knowledge gaps. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review of articles related to public health and SNSs using PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL to search for peer-reviewed publications describing the use of SNSs for public health research and practice. We also conducted manual searches of relevant publications. Each publication was independently reviewed by 2 researchers for inclusion and extracted relevant study data. Results: A total of 73 articles met our inclusion criteria. Most articles (n= 50) were published in the final 2 years covered by our search. In all, 58 articles were in the domain of public health research and 15 were in public health practice. Only 1 study was conducted in a low-income country. Most articles (63/73, 86%) described observational studies involving users or usages of SNSs; only 5 studies involved randomized controlled trials. A large proportion (43/73, 59%) of the identified studies included populations considered hard to reach, such as young individuals, adolescents, and individuals at risk of sexually transmitted diseases or alcohol and substance abuse. Few articles (2/73, 3%) described using the multidirectional communication potential of SNSs to engage study populations. Conclusions: The number of publications about public health uses for SNSs has been steadily increasing in the past 5 years. With few exceptions, the literature largely consists of observational studies describing users and usages of SNSs regarding topics of public health interest. More studies that fully exploit the communication tools embedded in SNSs and study their potential to produce significant effects in the overall population's health are needed.

Furthermore, there is interest in understanding how concerned the population is about a disease outbreak. Twitter can serve as an important data source to provide this information in real time. In this paper, we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter messages to measure the Degree of Concern (DOC) of the Twitter users. In order to achieve this goal, we develop a novel two-step sentiment classification workflow to automatically identify personal tweets and negative tweets. Based on this workflow, we present an Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System (ESMOS) that provides tools for visualizing Twitter users' concern towards different diseases. The visual concern map and chart in ESMOS can help public health officials to identify the progression and peaks of concern for a disease in space and time, so that appropriate preventive actions can be taken. The DOC measure is based on the sentiment-based classifications. We compare clue-based and different Machine Learning methods to classify sentiments of Twitter users regarding diseases, first into personal and neutral tweets and then into negative from neutral personal tweets. In our experiments, Multinomial Naive Bayes achieved overall the best results and took significantly less time to build the classifier than other methods.

Sensors do not, however, typically sense the social and ambient environment of the users, such as general life style attributes or information about their social network. This means that the users themselves, and the medical practitioners, privy to the wearable sensor data, only have a narrow view of the individual, limited mainly to certain aspects of their physical condition. In this paper we describe a number of use cases for how social media can be used to complement the check-up data and those from sensors to gain a more holistic view on individuals' health, a perspective we call the 360 degrees Quantified Self. Health-related information can be obtained from sources as diverse as food photo sharing, location check-ins, or profile pictures. Additionally, information from a person's ego network can shed light on the social dimension of wellbeing which is widely acknowledged to be of utmost importance, even though they are currently rarely used for medical diagnosis. We articulate a long-term vision describing the desirable list of technical advances and variety of data to achieve an integrated system encompassing Electronic Health Records (EHR), data from wearable devices, alongside information derived from social media data.

Continuity of care is also emphasised. However, many patients with COPD experience fragmented care. Discontinuities in healthcare and related social services are likely to result in disjointed rather than integrated care which can negatively affect patient health outcomes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to improve our understanding of, and how, contextual features pertaining to structures and processes of COPD integrated care influence delivery of care within patients' healthcare networks. Methods We conducted individual interviews with 28 participants (9 patients, 16 healthcare professionals, and 3 spousal caregivers). Participants were recruited through the lung clinic at a city hospital in western Canada. We employed a social network paradigm to analyse and interpret the data. Results The analysis revealed an overarching theme of fragmented COPD care with two sub-themes: (1) Funding shortfalls and availability of resources, and (2) Dis(mis)connected communication pathways. The overarching theme depicts variations, delays, and discontinuities in patient care. The sub-themes describe how macro level influences and meso level shortfalls were perceived to influence the availability of respiratory care resources that contributed to fragmented COPD care. Conclusions Employing a social network lens drew particular attention to family physicians' pivotal role in delivering community-based COPD care. While an integrated approach to care is recommended by care guidelines, institutional and organizational structures and processes, such as financial and communication structures, may inhibit delivery of integrated care. Thus, macro and meso level structures and processes have the potential to shape patient care by constraining family physicians' purposive and communication actions necessary for facilitating an integrated distributed approach to care. We propose a context of care which fosters a context for family physicians' delivery of patient-centered care. Integrated care delivery may improve patients' wellbeing and alleviate financial constraints on the healthcare system.

Communication, advice exchange and job satisfaction of nursing staff: a social network analyses of 35 long-term care units	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; WORK	Background: The behaviour of individuals is affected by the social networks in which they are embedded. Networks are also important for the diffusion of information and the influence of employees in organisations. Yet, at the moment little is known about the social networks of nursing staff in healthcare settings. This is the first study that investigates informal communication and advice networks of nursing staff in long-term care. We examine the structure of the networks, how they are related to the size of units and characteristics of nursing staff, and their relationship with job satisfaction. Methods: We collected social network data of 380 nursing staff of 35 units in group projects and psychogeriatric units in nursing homes and residential homes in the Netherlands. Communication and advice networks were analyzed in a social network application (UCINET), focusing on the number of contacts (density) between nursing staff on the units. We then studied the correlation between the density of networks, size of the units and characteristics of nursing staff. We used multilevel analyses to investigate the relationship between social networks and job satisfaction of nursing staff, taking characteristics of units and nursing staff into account. Results: Both communication and advice networks were negatively related to the number of residents and the number of nursing staff of the units. Communication and advice networks were more dense when more staff worked part-time. Furthermore, density of communication networks was positively related to the age of nursing staff of the units. Multilevel analyses showed that job satisfaction differed significantly between individual staff members and units and was influenced by the number of nursing staff of the units. However, this relationship disappeared when density of communication networks was added to the model. Conclusions: Overall, communication and advice networks of nursing staff in long-term care are relatively dense. This fits with the high level of cooperation that is needed to provide good care to residents. Social networks are more dense in small units and are also shaped by characteristics of staff members. The results furthermore show that communication networks are important for staff's job satisfaction.	[van Beek, Adriana P. A.; Wagner, Cordula; Spreeuwenberg, Peter P.

J	Bresadola, M				Bresadola, Marco			A Physician and a Man of Science: Patients, Physicians, and Diseases in Marcello Malpighi's Medical Practice	BULLETIN OF THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Marcello Malpighi; medical consultation; diseases; patients; physicians; early modern medicine; correspondence	18TH-CENTURY; EXPERIENCE	Marcello Malpighi (1628-94), the celebrated Italian anatomist, was also a very successful physician and, as his correspondence indicates, medical consultant by post. This article focuses on the professional and social network that developed around Malpighi's medical activity. The network played a major role in promoting Malpighi's professional career and in disseminating his scientific ideas. Malpighi's medical practice was indeed fully integrated within his views of the structure and functioning of the human body in health and disease. A fresh look into Malpighi's medical practice allows us to get new insights into early modern relations among medicine, the new science, and the identity of physicians.

Nico Bertoloni Meli's work has been a constant inspiration for my study of Malpighi. My thanks to Silvia De Renzi, Cynthia Klestinec, Michael McVaugh, and Hubert Steinke, who provided very insightful comments on earlier drafts of the article, and to the anonymous reviewers of the Bulletin, of the History of Medicine, who helped me to clarify my argument. The staff of Biblioteca Universitaria in Bologna was very kind and helpful with my research on Malpighi's manuscripts. Rosanna Ducati and Barbara Walker provided indispensable language advice.

Finally the results of research finding were five categories which were available; security; science and technology derived consequences for nursing; to monitor quality of nursing care; support from social network. The Virtual Visit of Tele-Nursing's concept will be leading nursing knowledge to theory.

However, several studies have shown that the quality of medical information published online varies drastically whatever the health topic addressed. The aim of this study is to use an existing rating tool on a set of social network web sites in order to assess the capabilities of these tools to guide experts for selecting the most adapted social network web site to mine ADRs. Methods: First, we reviewed and rated 132 Internet forums and social networks according to three major criteria: the number of visits, the notoriety of the forum and the number of messages posted in relation with health and drug therapy. Second, the pharmacist reviewed the topic-oriented message boards with a small number of drug names to ensure that they were not off topic. Six experts have been chosen to assess the selected internet forums using a French scoring tool: Net scoring. Three different scores and the agreement between experts according to each set of scores using weighted kappa pooled using mean have been computed. Results: Three internet forums were chosen at the end of the selection step. Some criteria get high score (scores 3-4) no matter the website evaluated like accessibility (45-46) or design (34-36), at the opposite some criteria always have bad scores like quantitative (40-42) and ethical aspect (43-44), hyperlinks actualization (30-33). Kappa were positives but very small which corresponds to a weak agreement between experts. Conclusion: The personal opinion of the expert seems to have a major impact, undermining the relevance of the criterion. Our future work is to collect results given by this evaluation grid and proposes a new scoring tool for Internet social networks assessment.

J	Long, JC; Cunningham, FC; Carswell, P; Braithwaite, J				Long, Janet C.; Cunningham, Frances C.; Carswell, Peter; Braithwaite, Jeffrey			Who are the key players in a new translational research network?	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; CLINICAL NETWORKS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; HEALTH RESEARCH; CONSEQUENCES; BEHAVIOR; SUPPORT; SCIENCE; QUALITY; BENCH	Background: Professional networks are used increasingly in health care to bring together members from different sites and professions to work collaboratively. Key players within these networks are known to affect network function through their central or brokerage position and are therefore of interest to those who seek to optimise network efficiency. However, their identity may not be apparent. This study using social network analysis to ask: (1) Who are the key players of a new translational research network (TRN)? (2) Do they have characteristics in common? (3) Are they recognisable as powerful, influential or well connected individuals? Methods: TRN members were asked to complete an on-line, whole network survey which collected demographic information expected to be associated with key player roles, and social network questions about collaboration in current TRN projects. Three questions asked who they perceived as powerful, influential and well connected. Indegree and betweenness centrality values were used to determine key player status in the actual and perceived networks and tested for association with demographic and descriptive variables using chi square analyses. Results: Response rate for the online survey was 76.4% (52/68). The TRN director and manager were identified as key players along with six other members. Only two of nine variables were associated with actual key player status; none with perceived. The main finding was the mismatch between actual and perceived brokers. Members correctly identified two of the three central actors (the two mandated key roles director and manager) but there were only three correctly identified actual brokers among the 19 perceived brokers. Possible reasons for the mismatch include overlapping structures and weak knowledge of members. Conclusions: The importance of correctly identifying these key players is discussed in terms of network interventions to improve efficiency.

Identifying Opinion Leaders to Promote Organ Donation on Social Media: Network Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social media; health promotion; organ donation; opinion leaders; social network analysis	COMMUNICATION; CENTRALITY; KNOWLEDGE; SITES; FLOW	Background: In the recent years, social networking sites (SNSs, also called social media) have been adopted in organ donation campaigns, and recruiting opinion leaders for such campaigns has been found effective in promoting behavioral changes. Objective: The aim of this paper was to focus on the dissemination of organ donation tweets on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and to examine the opinion leadership in the retweet network of popular organ donation messages using social network analysis. It also aimed to investigate how personal and social attributes contribute to a user's opinion leadership on the topic of organ donation. Methods: All messages about organ donation posted on Weibo from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 were extracted using Python Web crawler. A retweet network with 505,047 nodes and 545,312 edges of the popular messages (n=206) was constructed and analyzed. The local and global opinion leaderships were measured using network metrics, and the roles of personal attributes, professional knowledge, and social positions in obtaining the opinion leadership were examined using general linear model. Results: The findings revealed that personal attributes, professional knowledge, and social positions predicted individual's local opinion leadership in the retweet network of popular organ donation messages. Alternatively, personal attributes and social positions, but not professional knowledge, were significantly associated with global opinion leadership. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that health campaign designers may recruit peer leaders in SNS organ donation promotions to facilitate information sharing among the target audience. Users who are unverified, active, well connected, and experienced with information and communications technology (ICT) will accelerate the sharing of organ donation messages in the global environment. Medical professionals such as organ transplant surgeons who can wield a great amount of influence on their direct connections could also effectively participate in promoting organ donation on social media.

Design This was a quantitative study, with data obtained from three distinct sources: individual-level and social-network data from employees; use data from EMR system logs; and patient satisfaction data from patients and/or authorized decision-makers. Responses were obtained from 151 physicians and 8440 patient satisfaction surveys over the course of a 1-year period at the shakedown phase of an EMR system implementation. Results Physicians who were better connected, both directly and indirectly, to their peers that is, other physicians for advice on their work, used the system less than those who were less connected. In addition to such social network ties, demographic characteristics (gender and age), three personality characteristics (openness to experience, agreeableness and extroversion) and a key technology perception (perceived usefulness) predicted EMR system use. Conclusions For hospital administrators and other stakeholders, understanding the contributors to, and the relative importance of, various factors in explaining EMR system use, and its impact on patient satisfaction is of great importance. The factors identified in this work that influence a physician's use of EMR systems can be used to develop interventions and applications that can increase physician buy-in and use of EMR systems.

Peer effects on risky behaviors: New evidence from college roommate assignments	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						Peer effects; Risky behaviors; Substance use; Alcohol	LARGE SOCIAL NETWORK; MENTAL-HEALTH; SUBSTANCE USE; DRINKING; STUDENTS; SMOKING; FRIENDS; ADOLESCENTS; POPULATION; CONTAGION	Social scientists continue to devote considerable attention to spillover effects for risky behaviors because of the important policy implications and the persistent challenges in identifying unbiased causal effects. We use the natural experiment of assigned college roommates to estimate peer effects for several measures of health risks: binge drinking, smoking, illicit drug use, gambling, having multiple sex partners, suicidal ideation, and non-suicidal self-injury. We find significant peer effects for binge drinking but little evidence of effects for other outcomes, although there is tentative evidence that peer effects for smoking may be positive among men and negative among women. In contrast to prior research, the peer effects for binge drinking are significant for all subgroups defined by sex and prior drinking status. We also find that pre-existing risky behaviors predict the closeness of friendships, which underscores the significance of addressing selection biases in studies of peer effects.

The study involved 333 respondents who are active users of Facebook (FB). The short version of the IPAQ questionnaire and BMI Calculator were used to assess the physical activity of respondents. This research has determined that the BMI index (BMI) ranges from 16.04 to 42.25, average 24.00. The total level of physical activity of the participants, expressed through the Metabolic equivalent task (MET) is high, and according to the MET category the participants are in the high level of involvement category or HEPA active. There is a statistically significant correlation between the overall results obtained with the IPAQ compared to the MET category, BMI, quality of life and self-assessment of health in FB users. Participants spend on average 5 hours per day sitting during a week, and there is statistically significant correlation between the overall results of the IPAQ compared to the MET category and the time spent sitting.

J	Yang, CC; Yang, HD				Yang, Christopher C.; Yang, Haodong			Mining heterogeneous networks with topological features constructed from patient-contributed content for pharmacovigilance	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Drug safety; Adverse drug reaction; Drug-drug interactions; Heterogeneous networks; Social network mining	ADVERSE DRUG-REACTIONS; WEB	Drug safety, also called pharmacovigilance, represents a serious health problem all over the world. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are two important issues in pharmacovigilance, and how to detect drug safety signals has drawn many researchers' attention and efforts. Currently, methods proposed for ADR and DDI detection are mainly based on traditional data sources such as spontaneous reporting data, electronic health records, pharmaceutical databases, and biomedical literature. However, these data sources are either limited by under-reporting ratio, privacy issues, high cost, or long publication cycle. In this study, we propose a framework for drug safety signal detection by harnessing online health community data, a timely, informative, and publicly available data source. Concretely, we used MedHelp as the data source to collect patient-contributed content based on which a weighted heterogeneous network was constructed. We extracted topological features from the network, quantified them with different weighting methods, and used supervised learning method for both ADR and DDI signal detection. In addition, after identifying DDI signals, we proposed a new metric, named Interaction Ratio, to identify associated ADRs due to suspected interactions. The experiment results showed that our proposed techniques outperforms baseline methods.

Despite growing research evidence supporting CIs' potential, CI-related research is still in its infancy. There is a lack of systematic investigation that goes beyond publication review and presents the state of the art from perspectives of funding agencies, academia, and industry by incorporating CI-related public funding and patent activities. Objective: This study aimed to use data systematically extracted from multiple sources (ie, grant, publication, and patent databases) to investigate the development, research, and fund application of health-related CIs and associated stakeholders (ie, countries, organizations, and collaborators). Methods: A multifaceted search query was executed to retrieve records from 9 databases. Bibliometric analysis, social network analysis, and term co-occurrence analysis were conducted on the screened records. Results: This review included 42 funded projects, 428 research publications, and 162 patents. The total dollar amount of grants awarded was US $30,297,932, of which US $13,513,473 was awarded by US funding agencies and US $16,784,459 was funded by the Europe Commission. The top 3 funding agencies in the United States were the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Boston Medical Center was awarded the largest combined grant size (US $2,246,437) for 4 projects. The authors of the publications were from 58 countries and 566 organizations; the top 3 most productive organizations were Northeastern University (United States), Universiti Teknologi MARA (Malaysia), and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS; France). US researchers produced 114 publications. Although 82.0% (464/566) of the organizations engaged in interorganizational collaboration, 2 organizational research-collaboration clusters were observed with Northeastern University and CNRS as the central nodes. About 112 organizations from the United States and China filed 87.7% patents. IBM filed most patents (N=17). Only 5 patents were co-owned by different organizations, and there was no across-country collaboration on patenting activity. The terms patient, child, elderly, and robot were frequently discussed in the 3 record types. The terms related to mental and chronic issues were discussed mainly in grants and publications. The terms regarding multimodal interactions were widely mentioned as users' communication modes with CIs in the identified records. Conclusions: Our findings provided an overview of the countries, organizations, and topic terms in funded projects, as well as the authorship, collaboration, content, and related information of research publications and patents. There is a lack of broad cross-sector partnerships among grant agencies, academia, and industry, particularly in the United States. Our results suggest a need to improve collaboration among public and private sectors and health care organizations in research and patent activities.

Objective: To conduct a systematic review of studies of professionals' network structures, identifying factors associated with network effectiveness and sustainability, particularly in relation to quality of care and patient safety. Methods: The authors searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science and Business Source Premier from January 1995 to December 2009. Results: A majority of the 26 unique studies identified used social network analysis to examine structural relationships in networks: structural relationships within and between networks, health professionals and their social context, health collaboratives and partnerships, and knowledge sharing networks. Key aspects of networks explored were administrative and clinical exchanges, network performance, integration, stability and influences on the quality of healthcare. More recent studies show that cohesive and collaborative health professional networks can facilitate the coordination of care and contribute to improving quality and safety of care. Structural network vulnerabilities include cliques, professional and gender homophily, and over-reliance on central agencies or individuals. Conclusions: Effective professional networks employ natural structural network features (eg, bridges, brokers, density, centrality, degrees of separation, social capital, trust) in producing collaboratively oriented healthcare. This requires efficient transmission of information and social and professional interaction within and across networks. For those using networks to improve care, recurring success factors are understanding your network's characteristics, attending to its functioning and investing time in facilitating its improvement. Despite this, there is no guarantee that time spent on networks will necessarily improve patient care.

The question is whether they can be successfully incorporated into health programmes to promote physical activity. Aims: To measure the effect of a WhatsApp-based intervention for promoting physical activity among female college students in Abha, Saudi Arabia. Methods: This randomized controlled trial from November 2019 to January 2020 included 110 students. The intervention group received a brief orientation on exercise and up to 4 physical activity promotion messages per week via WhatsApp for 10 weeks. The messages were obtained from the websites of the US Centers for Disease Control and World Health Or-ganization (WHO). Physical activity was assessed at baseline and at 10-weeks' follow-up using the WHO Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results: The 2 groups were similar in sociodemographic and baseline physical activity levels. Postintervention data anal-ysis revealed significant improvement in the proportion of participants with moderate-intensity physical activity in the work and recreation domains. Compared with the control group, mean metabolic equivalents/week of the intervention group improved significantly. The mean difference in total physical activity before and after intervention was significant in all domains and in all categories of activity. The proportion of participants who met the WHO criteria for minimum physical activity per week increased from 69.8% to 90.5% after intervention. Conclusion: Social-network-based interventions improve physical activity and may be incorporated into youth-targeted health programmes.

In order to work preventively with decreasing ADHD and ASD symptoms, there is a need of more knowledge concerning risk factors. Objective: This study aimed to investigate school, health, lifestyle and social interactions association with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among schoolchildren aged 6-17 years. Methods: Data for 18,416 children and adolescents aged 6-17 years in the county of Varmland, Sweden, from the school year 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 were obtained from the Student Health Database, which includes information on health examinations by school nurses and self-reported information of mental and physical health, social relations, physical activity, and school conditions. Results: Of all participants, 2.4% reported only ADHD and 1.6% reported only ASD. The results confirmed that ADHD or ASD was significantly associated with worse school experiences, lower socioeconomic status, less physical activity, more substance use, weaker social network and more impairments than those without ADHD or ASD. Conclusions: Knowledge of risk or protective factors during school years is needed to develop interventions to reduce symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders in children and adolescents.

In contrast, a loved one's negative response to cancer can diminish survivors' QoL, and these negative responses can be more impactful than supportive behaviors. Nonetheless, negative caregiver response has not been extensively researched, and few studies have explored the potential interaction of negative caregiver response and perceived social support on survivors' QoL. Therefore, we examined direct effects of perceived negative caregiver response, and the potential moderating role of social support, on QoL in a population-based sample of cancer survivors (N = 7543) using generalized linear models. Findings indicate that survivors who rated their caregiver's response to their cancer diagnosis more negatively reported worse physical and mental health, even up to 10 years after their initial cancer diagnosis. Perceived social support was not significantly associated with physical health, but it was positively associated with mental health. However, social support was not shown to moderate the relationship between negative caregiver response and mental health. Findings suggest that positive support from others within a survivor's social network may not be enough to attenuate the negative effects of their primary caregiver's unsupportive behaviors. Accordingly, cancer survivorship research and practice must consider the critical role that negative caregiver responses have on survivors' QoL and develop strategies that focus on the survivor-caregiver dynamic.

Association of Financial Literacy With Hospitalization in Community-dwelling Older Adults	MEDICAL CARE			English	Article						Literacy; finances; hospitalization; aging	HEALTH LITERACY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RUSH MEMORY; PEOPLE; RISK; CARE	Background:Lowering the likelihood of hospitalization in older adults is a major public health goal for modern health care systems. Emerging data suggest that financial literacy is an important determinant of health outcomes in old age, but the relationship with hospitalization has not been explored.Objective:To test the hypothesis that better financial literacy is related to lower risk of hospitalization in older persons.Design:Prospective cohort study.Participants:Data came from community-dwelling older adults (n=388) without dementia enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project.Main Measures:Participants underwent detailed assessment of financial literacy and cognition. Data on hospitalizations were obtained from linked Medicare claims records (MedPAR file).Results:Over an average of 1.8 years, 117 participants (30%) were hospitalized, and a third of those hospitalized experienced multiple hospitalizations. In a modified Poisson regression model adjusted for age, sex, education, and cognition, better financial literacy was associated with lower risk of hospitalization. In a model further adjusted for income, physical activity, body mass index, smoking, social network size, chronic conditions, basic and instrumental activities of daily living disability, and depressive symptoms, the association was unchanged. Secondary analyses showed the association was primarily driven by conceptual knowledge rather than numeracy.Conclusions:Higher financial literacy is related to a lower risk of hospitalization in older persons without dementia, after adjusting for cognitive, health, functional, and socioeconomic factors. The ability to understand and utilize financial concepts may represent a potentially modifiable risk factor for hospitalization in later life.

J	Long, JC; Cunningham, FC; Wiley, J; Carswell, P; Braithwaite, J				Long, Janet C.; Cunningham, Frances C.; Wiley, Janice; Carswell, Peter; Braithwaite, Jeffrey			Leadership in complex networks: the importance of network position and strategic action in a translational cancer research network	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Network analysis; Leadership; Health sector; Centrality; Brokerage; Key players; Research	HEALTH; BEHAVIOR; SCIENCE; BENCH; TIES	Background: Leadership behaviour in complex networks is under-researched, and little has been written concerning leadership of translational research networks (TRNs) that take discoveries made 'at the bench' and translate them into practices used 'at the bedside.' Understanding leaders' opportunities and behaviours within TRNs working to solve this key problem in implementing evidence into clinical practice is therefore important. This study explored the network position of governing body members and perceptions of their role in a new TRN in Sydney, Australia. The paper asks three questions: Firstly, do the formal, mandated leaders of this TRN hold key positions of centrality or brokerage in the informal social network of collaborative ties? Secondly, if so, do they recognise the leadership opportunities that their network positions afford them? Thirdly, what activities associated with these key roles do they believe will maximise the TRN's success? Methods: Semi-structured interviews of all 14 governing body members conducted in early 2012 explored perceptions of their roles and sought comments on a list of activities drawn from review of successful transdisciplinary collaboratives combined with central and brokerage roles. An on-line, whole network survey of all 68 TRN members sought to understand and map existing collaborative connections. Leaders' positions in the network were assessed using UCInet, and graphs were generated in NetDraw. Results: Social network analysis identified that governing body members had high centrality and high brokerage potential in the informal network of work-related ties. Interviews showed perceived challenges including 'silos' and the mismatch between academic and clinical goals of research. Governing body members recognised their central positions, which would facilitate the leadership roles of leading, making decisions, and providing expert advice necessary for the co-ordination of effort and relevant input across domains. Brokerage potential was recognised in their clearly understood role of representing a specialty, campus or research group on the governing body to provide strategic linkages. Facilitation, mentoring and resolving conflicts within more localised project teams were spoken of as something 'we do all the time anyway,' as well as something they would do if called upon. These leadership roles are all linked with successful collaborative endeavours in other fields. Conclusions: This paper links the empirical findings of the social network analysis with the qualitative findings of the interviews to show that the leaders' perceptions of their roles accord with both the potential inherent in their network positions as well as actual activities known to increase the success of transdisciplinary teams. Understanding this is key to successful TRNs.

Mechanisms of Communicating Health Information Through Facebook: Implications for Consumer Health Information Technology Design	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						consumer health information; medical informatics; Facebook; social networks; health communication	SOCIAL MEDIA; DEPRESSION DISCLOSURES; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; CHRONIC DISEASE; ENGAGEMENT; NETWORKING; OUTCOMES; CARE	Background: Consumer health information technology (IT) solutions are designed to support patient health management and have the ability to facilitate patients' health information communication with their social networks. However, there is a need for consumer health IT solutions to align with patients' health management preferences for increased adoption of the technology. It may be possible to gain an understanding of patients' needs for consumer health IT supporting their health information communication with social networks by explicating how they have adopted and adapted social networking sites, such as Facebook, for this purpose. Objective: Our aim was to characterize patients' use of all communication mechanisms within Facebook for health information communication to provide insight into how consumer health IT solutions may be better designed to meet patients' communication needs and preferences. Methods: This study analyzed data about Facebook communication mechanisms use from a larger, three-phase, sequential, mixed-methods study. We report here on the results of the study's first phase: qualitative interviews (N=25). Participants were over 18, used Facebook, were residents or citizens of the United States, spoke English, and had a diagnosis consistent with type 2 diabetes. Participants were recruited through Facebook groups and pages. Participant interviews were conducted via Skype or telephone between July and September 2014. Data analysis was grounded in qualitative content analysis and the initial coding framework was informed by the findings of a previous study. Results: Participants' rationales for the use or disuse of a particular Facebook mechanism to communicate health information reflected six broad themes: (1) characteristics and circumstances of the person, (2) characteristics and circumstances of the relationship, (3) structure and composition of the social network, (4) content of the information, (5) communication purpose, and (6) attributes of the technology. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that participants consider multiple factors when choosing a Facebook mechanism for health information communication. Factors included what information they intended to share, what they were trying to accomplish, attributes of technology, and attributes and communication practices of their social networks. There is a need for consumer health IT that allows for a range of choices to suit the intersectionality of participants' rationales. Technology that better meets patients' needs may lead to better self-management of health conditions, and therefore, improve overall health outcomes.

Objective: We aimed to examine rates of uptake and ongoing usage, and factors influencing uptake, ongoing usage, and engagement for a consumer health informatics (CHI) intervention for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention among African American young adults, using the diffusion of innovation theory, trust-centered design framework, and O'Brien and Toms' model of engagement. Methods: This community-based participatory mixed methods study included surveys at four time points (n=315; 280 African American participants) among young adults aged 18 to 24 years involved in a blended offline/online HIV/STI prevention intervention (HIV Outreach, Prevention, and Education [HOPE] eIntervention), which was described as a "HOPE party." Qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of participants (n=19) after initial surveys and website server logs indicated low uptake and ongoing usage. A generalized linear mixed-effects model identified predictors of eIntervention uptake, server logs were summarized to describe use over time, and interview transcripts were coded and thematically analyzed to identify factors affecting uptake and engagement. Results: Participants' initial self-reported eIntervention uptake was low, but increased significantly over time, although uptake never reached expectations. The most frequent activity was visiting the website. Demographic factors and HOPE party social network characteristics were not significantly correlated with uptake, although participant education and party network gender homophily approached significance. According to interviews, one factor driving uptake was the desire to share HIV/STI prevention information with others. Survey and interview results showed that technology access, perceived time, and institutional and technological trust were necessary conditions for uptake. Interviews revealed that factors undermining uptake were insufficient promotion and awareness building, and the platform of the intervention, with social media being less appealing due to previous negative experiences concerning discussion of sexuality on social media. During the interaction with the eIntervention, interview data showed that factors driving initial engagement were audience-targeted website esthetics and appealing visuals. Ongoing usage was impeded by insufficiently frequent updates. Similarly, lack of novelty drove disengagement, although a social media contest for sharing intervention content resulted in some re-engagement. Conclusions: To encourage uptake, CHI interventions for African American young adults can better leverage users' desires to share information about HIV/STI prevention with others. Ensuring implementation through trusted organizations is also important, though vigorous promotion is needed. Visual appeal and targeted content foster engagement at first, but ongoing usage may require continual content changes. A thorough analysis of CHI intervention use can inform the development of future interventions to promote uptake and engagement. To guide future analyses, we present an expanded uptake and engagement model for CHI interventions targeting African American young adults based on our empirical results.

Yet, compared to studies of professional implementation, patient systems of implementation remain under-investigated. The aim of this paper is to explore the work, meaning and function attributed to 'weaker' ties relative to other more bonding relationships in order to identify the place of these within a context of systems of support for long-term conditions. Methods: This is a mixed methods survey with nested qualitative study. A total of 300 people from deprived areas in the North West of England with chronic illnesses took part in a survey conducted in 2010 to 2011. A concentric circles diagram was used as a research tool with which participants identified 2,544 network members who contributed to illness management. Notions of 'work' were used to describe activities associated with chronic illness and to identify how weaker ties are included and perceived to be involved through social network members (SNM) contributions. Results: The results provide an articulation of how SNMs are substantially involved in weak tie illness management. Weaker ties constituted 16.1% of network membership involved in illness work. The amount of work undertaken was similar but less than that of stronger ties. Weaker ties appeared more durable and less liable to loss over time than stronger ties. The qualitative accounts suggested that weak ties enabled the moral positioning of the self-managing 'self' and acted on the basis of a strong sense of reciprocity. Conclusions: Weak ties act as an acceptable bridge between a sense of personal agency and control and the need for external support because it is possible to construct a sense of moral acceptability through reciprocal exchange. Access to weak tie resources needs to be taken into account when considering the ways in which systems of health implementation for chronic illness are designed and delivered.

J	Kennedy, A; Vassilev, I; James, E; Rogers, A				Kennedy, Anne; Vassilev, Ivaylo; James, Elizabeth; Rogers, Anne			Implementing a social network intervention designed to enhance and diversify support for people with long-term conditions. A qualitative study	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Social networks; Long-term conditions; Self-management support; Qualitative	SELF-MANAGEMENT SUPPORT; HEALTH LITERACY; WORK; CARE; ORGANIZATIONS; INFORMATION; RELEVANCE	Background: For people with long-term conditions, social networks provide a potentially central means of mobilising, mediating and accessing support for health and well-being. Few interventions address the implementation of improving engagement with and through social networks. This paper describes the development and implementation of a web-based tool which comprises: network mapping, user-centred preference elicitation and need assessment and facilitated engagement with resources. The study aimed to determine whether the intervention was acceptable, implementable and acted to enhance support and to add to theory concerning social networks and engagement with resources and activities. Methods: A longitudinal design with 15 case studies used ethnographic methods comprising video, non-participant observation of intervention delivery and qualitative interviews (baseline, 6 and 12 months). Participants were people with type 2 diabetes living in a marginalised island community. Facilitators were local health trainers and care navigators. Analysis applied concepts concerning implementation of technology for self-management support to explain how new practices of work were operationalised and how the technology impacted on relationships fit with everyday life and allowed for visual feedback. Results: Most participants reported identifying and taking up new activities as a result of using the tool. Thematic analysis suggested that workability of the tool was predicated on disruption and reconstruction of networks, challenging/supportive facilitation and change and reflection over time concerning network support. Visualisation of the network enabled people to mobilise support and engage in new activities. The tool aligned synergistically with the facilitators' role of linking people to local resources. Conclusions: The social network tool works through a process of initiating positive disruption of established selfmanagement practice through mapping and reflection on personal network membership and support. This opens up possibilities for reconstructing self-management differently from current practice. Key facets of successful implementation were: the visual maps of networks and support options; facilitation characterised by a perceived lack of status difference which assisted engagement and constructive discussion of support and preferences for activities; and background work (a reliable database, tailored preferences, option reduction) for facilitator and user ease of use.

An Observational Study of Social and Emotional Support in Smoking Cessation Twitter Accounts: Content Analysis of Tweets	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						smoking cessation; Twitter; Internet; social network	PRIMARY-CARE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ONLINE; RECRUITMENT; INTERVENTIONS; NETWORK; TRIALS	Background: Smoking continues to be the number one preventable cause of premature death in the United States. While evidence for the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions has increased rapidly, questions remain on how to effectively disseminate these findings. Twitter, the second largest online social network, provides a natural way of disseminating information. Health communicators can use Twitter to inform smokers, provide social support, and attract them to other interventions. A key challenge for health researchers is how to frame their communications to maximize the engagement of smokers. Objective: Our aim was to examine current Twitter activity for smoking cessation. Methods: Active smoking cessation related Twitter accounts (N=18) were identified. Their 50 most recent tweets were content coded using a schema adapted from the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a theory-based, validated coding method. Using negative binomial regression, the association of number of followers and frequency of individual tweet content at baseline was assessed. The difference in followership at 6 months (compared to baseline) to the frequency of tweet content was compared using linear regression. Both analyses were adjusted by account type (organizational or not organizational). Results: The 18 accounts had 60,609 followers at baseline and 68,167 at 6 months. A total of 24% of tweets were socioemotional support (mean 11.8, SD 9.8), 14% (mean 7, SD 8.4) were encouraging/engagement, and 62% (mean 31.2, SD 15.2) were informational. At baseline, higher frequency of socioemotional support and encouraging/engaging tweets was significantly associated with higher number of followers (socioemotional: incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.20; encouraging/engaging: IRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.12). Conversely, higher frequency of informational tweets was significantly associated with lower number of followers (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98). At 6 months, for every increase by 1 in socioemotional tweets, the change in followership significantly increased by 43.94 (P=.027); the association was slightly attenuated after adjusting by account type and was not significant (P=.064). Conclusions: Smoking cessation activity does exist on Twitter. Preliminary findings suggest that certain content strategies can be used to encourage followership, and this needs to be further investigated.

Objective: In this paper we investigated how people evaluate robots that provide care and how they form impressions of the patient the robot cares for, based on how the robot represents the patient. Methods: We have used a vignette-based study, showing participants hypothetical scenarios describing behaviors of assistive robots (patient-centered or task-centered) and measured their influence on people's evaluations of the robot itself (emotional intelligence [EI], trustworthiness, and acceptability) as well as people's perceptions of the patient for whom the robot provides care. Results: We found that for scenarios describing a robot that acts in a patient-centered manner, the robot will not only be perceived as having higher EI (P=.003) but will also cause people to form more positive impressions of the patient that the robot cares for (P<.001). We replicated and expanded these results to other domains such as dieting, learning, and job training.

The latest publicly available rates showed that 85.6% of the new cases were diagnosed in people under 29 years old. The information and communication technologies are among the most powerful influences in the lives of young people. The Internet can potentially represent a way to educate on sexual health and encourage young people, and especially youth, to be tested for STDs. If hospital websites include an easy and anonymous system for scheduling appointments with the clinic, it is possible that this could lead to an increase in the number of people tested for STDs. Methods: The purpose of the study is to assess the impact of a game-based appointment system on the frequency of consultations at a venereology unit and on the use of an educational web app. An A/B testing methodology is used. Users from the city of Tromso, in North Norway, will be randomized to one of the two versions of the game-style web app on sexual health at www.sjekkdeg.no. Group A will have access to educational content only, while group B will have, in addition, access to a game-based appointment system with automatic prioritization. After one year of the trial, it will be analyzed if the game-based appointment system increases the number of consultations at the venereology unit and if health professionals deem the system useful. Discussion: This study will explore if facilitating the access to health services for youth through the use of a game-based appointment system integrated in a game-style web app on sexual health education can have an impact on appointment rates.

User engagement, information exposure, and social influence mechanisms can play a significant role in the utility of these platforms. Objective: In this paper, we characterize peer interactions in an online community for chronic disease management. Our objective is to identify key communications and study their prevalence in online social interactions. Methods: The American Diabetes Association Online community is an online social network for diabetes self-management. We analyzed 80,481 randomly selected deidentified peer-to-peer messages from 1212 members, posted between June 1, 2012, and May 30, 2019. Our mixed methods approach comprised qualitative coding and automated text analysis to identify, visualize, and analyze content-specific communication patterns underlying diabetes self-management. Results: Qualitative analysis revealed that "social support" was the most prevalent theme (84.9%), followed by "readiness to change" (18.8%), "teachable moments" (14.7%), "pharmacotherapy" (13.7%), and "progress" (13.3%). The support vector machine classifier resulted in reasonable accuracy with a recall of 0.76 and precision 0.78 and allowed us to extend our thematic codes to the entire data set. Conclusions: Modeling health-related communication through high throughput methods can enable the identification of specific content related to sustainable chronic disease management, which facilitates targeted health promotion.

Quebec (Canada) is no exception, where successive governments have struggled for decades with apparently intractable problems in care accessibility overall, poor performance, and rising costs. This article explores the underlying causes of the disconnection between the high salience of healthcare system dysfunctions in both media and policy debates and the lack of policy change likely to remedy those dysfunctions. Academically, public policies' evolution is usually conceptualized as the product of complex, long-term interactions among diverse groups with specific power sources and preferences. In this context, we wanted to examine empirically whether divergences in stakeholders' views concerning various healthcare reform options could explain why certain policy changes are not implemented despite consensus on their programmatic coherence. The research design was an exploratory sequential design. Data were analyzed narratively as well as graphically using a method derived from social network analysis and graph theory. Results showed striking intergroup convergence around a programmatically sound policy package centred on the general objective of strengthening primary care delivery capacities. Those results, interpreted in light of political science elitist perspectives on the policy process, suggest that the incapacity to reform the system might be explained by one or two groups' having a de facto veto in policy-making.

A Study Examining the Influence of Proximity to Nurse Education Resources on Quality of Care Outcomes in Nursing Homes	INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING			English	Article						Alabama; geographic information systems; nursing; nursing homes; quality outcomes	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; WORK ENVIRONMENTS; JOB-SATISFACTION; RETENTION; HOSPITALS; SHORTAGE	This examination seeks to determine the influence of proximal density to nurse education resources (nursing schools) on nursing home care quality outcomes in Alabama. Motivated by the social network theory, which highlights the influence of relational closeness on shared resources and values, we hypothesize that nursing homes that have higher levels of nursing education resources within a close proximity will exhibit significantly higher nursing home quality outcomes. As proximal density to nurse education resources increases, the opportunity for nursing homes to build closer, stronger ties increase, leading to higher quality outcomes. We examine this hypothesis via ordered logistic regressions of proximal density measures developed through geographic information systems (GIS) software, nurse education resource data from Johnson & Johnson's Campaign for Nursing's Future (n = 37), and nursing home quality outcome data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services's (CMS) Nursing Home Compare from 2016 (n = 226). The results find that increases in proximal density to nurse education resources have a negative and significant association with nursing home quality outcomes in Alabama. Additional sensitivity analysis, which examines the degree to which the nature of this relationship is sensitive to health care facilities' location in high-density areas, is offered and confirms principal findings. Because nursing programs generally have stronger ties with hospitals, the findings suggest that the nursing homes in areas with higher nurse education resources may actually face greater competition for nurses.

To analyze the existing online social networks dedicated to health issues, we performed an active search on the Internet for such Web sites and analyzed their features according to the content analysis method. Methods: The study was performed in September and October 2009. We analyzed a sample of health social networks for patients, selected using four common search engines. A codebook was elaborated to investigate four areas: general information; technical characteristics and utilities; characteristics of the Web site and contents, both general and related to the online community. Results: The search led to a sample of 41 social networks. Twenty-three Web sites (56.1%) were dedicated to several diseases, the others to one only. Although the majority of the sample (87.8%) provided a way to contact the Web site, only five (12.2%) showed the name of the author or operating organization. Eight Web sites (19.5%) indicated one or more sponsors, and nine (22.0%) named one or more partners. It was often hard to tell whether an institution mentioned was a sponsor or a partner. Five Web sites (12.2%) enabled users to buy health-related products online. Twelve Web sites (29.3%) offered users the chance to search for doctors, and 12 (29.3%) gave therapeutic information. Two Web sites (4.9%) published aggregate statistical data about the patients registered with the social network. Conclusions: The data reveal the high heterogeneity of health-related social networks and raise interesting considerations on such controversial topics as the quality of online health information, research perspectives, interactivity, and empowerment. In particular, our findings are relevant to criticism regarding the openness and transparency of these Web sites, the use of personal data, and privacy issues.

Characterizing Vaping Industry Political Influence and Mobilization on Facebook: Social Network Analysis	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						vaping; alternative tobacco industry; e-cigarettes; Facebook; social network analysis; social networks; ehealth; health policy	TOBACCO PRODUCT USE; RANDOM GRAPH MODELS; UNITED-STATES; CENTRALITY; FAMILY; MARKET; TAX; AGE	Background: In response to recent policy efforts to regulate tobacco and vaping products, the vaping industry has been aggressive in mobilizing opposition by using a network of manufacturers, trade associations, and tobacco user communities, and by appealing to the general public. One strategy the alternative tobacco industry uses to mobilize political action is coordinating on social media platforms, such as the social networking site Facebook. However, few studies have specifically assessed how platforms such as Facebook are used to influence public sentiment and attitudes towards tobacco control policy. Objective: This study used social network analysis to examine how the alternative tobacco industry uses Facebook to mobilize online users to influence tobacco control policy outcomes with a focus on the state of California. Methods: Data were collected from local and national alternative tobacco Facebook groups that had affiliations with activities in the state of California. Network ties were constructed based on users' reactions to posts (eg, "like" and "love") and comments to characterize political mobilization networks. Results: Findings show that alternative tobacco industry employees were more likely to engage within these networks and that these employees were also more likely to be influential members (ie, be more active) in the network. Comparisons between subnetworks show that communication within the local alternative tobacco advocacy group network was less dense and more centralized in contrast to a national advocacy group that had overall higher levels of engagement among members. A timeline analysis found that a higher number of influential posts that disseminated widely across networks occurred during e-cigarette-related legislative events, suggesting strategic online engagement and increased mobilization of online activity for the purposes of influencing policy outcomes. Conclusions: Results from this study provide important insights into how tobacco industry-related advocacy groups leverage the Facebook platform to mobilize their online constituents in an effort to influence public perceptions and coordinate to defeat tobacco control efforts at the local, state, and federal level. Study results reveal one part of a vast network of socially enabled alternative tobacco industry actors and constituents that use Facebook as a mobilization point to support goals of the alternative tobacco industry.

Adaptation of community-based distribution of family planning services to context-specific social networks: a case of marriage counsellors in Lusaka district, Zambia	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Community-based distribution; Pre-marital Counselling; Social networks; Fertility decisions	INJECTABLE CONTRACEPTIVES; FERTILITY; BARRIERS; WOMEN	Background The significant contribution of community-based distribution (CBD) of family planning services and contraceptives to the uptake of contraceptives in hard-to-reach communities has resulted in the scaling-up of this approach in many Sub-Saharan countries. However, contextual factors need to be taken into consideration. For example, social network influence (e.g. spouse/partner, in-laws, and parents) on fertility decisions in many African and Asian societies is inevitable because of the social organisational structures. Hence the need to adapt CBD strategies to the social network context of a given society. Methods Data collection involved structured interviews from August 2018 to March 2019. Randomly selected respondents (n = 149) were recruited from four purposively selected health facilities in Lusaka district, Zambia. Respondents were screened for age (> 15 yrs.) and marital status. A mix of categorical and qualitative data was generated. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS (R)(24)) was used to carry out descriptive analysis and tests of association (Fisher's exact) while Nvivo (R)(12) was used to analyse the qualitative data using a deductive thematic approach. Results The results indicate that pre-marriage counselling (pre-MC) influences key elements of the husband-wife relationship (p > 0.005), namely; sexual relationship, inter-personal communication, assignation of roles and responsibilities, leadership and authority. These elements of the husband-wife relationship also affect how spouses/partners interact when making fertility decisions. More importantly, the majority (86%) of the respondents indicated having a continuing relationship with their marriage counsellors because of the need to consult them on marital issues. Conclusion Marriage counsellors, though hardly reported in fertility studies, are important 'constituents' of the social network in the Zambian society. This is because marriage counsellors are trusted sources of information about marital issues and often consulted about family planning but perceived not to have the correct information about modern contraceptives. In this context, pre-MC offers a readily available, sustainable and culturally appropriate platform for disseminating accurate information about modern contraceptives provided in a private and personal manner. Therefore, the CBD strategy in Zambia can harness marriage counsellors by recruiting and training them as community agents.

These technologies or tools can be used for a variety of purposes: to instantly debate issues, discover news, analyze research, network with peers, crowd-source information, seek support, and provide advice. Not all tools are implemented successfully; in many cases, the nonusage attrition rates are high. Little is known about the preferences of the Dutch general population regarding the use of the Internet and social media in health care. Objective: To determine the preferences of the general population in the Netherlands regarding the use of the Internet and social media in health care. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was disseminated via a popular Dutch online social network. Respondents were asked where they searched for health-related information, how they qualified the value of different sources, and their preferences regarding online communication with health care providers. Results were weighed for the Dutch population based on gender, age, and level of education using official statistics. Numbers and percentages or means and standard deviations were presented for different subgroups. One-way ANOVA was used to test for statistical differences. Results: The survey was completed by 635 respondents. The Internet was found to be the number one source for health-related information (82.7%), closely followed by information provided by health care professionals (71.1%). Approximately one-third (32.3%) of the Dutch population search for ratings of health care providers. The most popular information topics were side effects of medication (62.5%) and symptoms (59.7%). Approximately one-quarter of the Dutch population prefer to communicate with a health care provider via social media (25.4%), and 21.2% would like to communicate via a webcam. Conclusions: The Internet is the main source of health-related information for the Dutch population. One in 4 persons wants to communicate with their physician via social media channels and it is expected that this number will further increase. Health care providers should explore new ways of communicating online and should facilitate ways for patients to connect with them. Future research should aim at comparing different patient groups and diseases, describing best practices, and determining cost-effectiveness.	[Van de Belt, Tom H.; Engelen, Lucien J. L. P.

J	Grills, NJ; Robinson, P; Phillip, M				Grills, Nathan J.; Robinson, Priscilla; Phillip, Maneesh			Networking between community health programs: a case study outlining the effectiveness, barriers and enablers	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article								Background: In India, since the 1990s, there has been a burgeoning of NGOs involved in providing primary health care. This has resulted in a complex NGO-Government interface which is difficult for lone NGOs to navigate. The Uttarakhand Cluster, India, links such small community health programs together to build NGO capacity, increase visibility and better link to the government schemes and the formal healthcare system. This research, undertaken between 1998 and 2011, aims to examine barriers and facilitators to such linking, or clustering, and the effectiveness of this clustering approach. Methods: Interviews, indicator surveys and participant observation were used to document the process and explore the enablers, the barriers and the effectiveness of networks improving community health. Results: The analysis revealed that when activating, framing, mobilising and synthesizing the Uttarakhand Cluster, key brokers and network players were important in bridging between organisations. The ties (or relationships) that held the cluster together included homophily around common faith, common friendships and geographical location and common mission. Self interest whereby members sought funds, visibility, credibility, increased capacity and access to trainings was also a commonly identified motivating factor for networking. Barriers to network synthesizing included lack of funding, poor communication, limited time and lack of human resources. Risk aversion and mistrust remained significant barriers to overcome for such a network. Conclusions: In conclusion, specific enabling factors allowed the clustering approach to be effective at increasing access to resources, creating collaborative opportunities and increasing visibility, credibility and confidence of the cluster members. These findings add to knowledge regarding social network formation and collaboration, and such knowledge will assist in the conceptualisation, formation and success of potential health networks in India and other developing world countries.

First, it categorizes the Twitter handles tweeted flu related information based on the amount of replies and mentions within the Twitter network. The collected Twitter accounts are categorized as media, health related individuals, organizations, government, individuals with no background with media or medical field, in order to test the relationship between centrality measures of the accounts and their categories. The second objective is to examine the relationship between the importance of the Twitter accounts in the network, centrality measures, and specific characteristics of each account, including the number of tweets and followers as well as the number of accounts followed and liked. Methods: Using Twitter search network API, tweets with "flu" keyword were collected and tabulated. Network centralities were calculated with network analysis tool, NodeXL. The collected Twitters accounts were content analyzed and categorized by multiple coders. Results: When the media or organizational Twitter accounts were present in the list of important Twitter accounts, they were highly effective disseminating flu-related information. Also, they were more likely to stay active one year after the data collection period compared to other influential individual accounts. Conclusions: Health campaigns are recommended to focus on recruiting influential Twitter accounts and encouraging them to retweet or mention in order to produce better results in disseminating information. Although some individual social media users were valuable assets in terms of spreading information about flu, media and organization handles were more reliable information distributors. Thus, health information practitioners are advised to design health campaigns better utilizing media and organizations rather than individuals to achieve consistent and efficient campaign outcomes.

This systematic review seeks to uncover whether social interventions have an effect on social and health-related measures among nursing home residents. The authors screened PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO for relevant peer-reviewed literature. Interventions were included if (1) they focused primarily on social relations or related terms such as loneliness, social support, social isolation, social network, or being involuntarily alone either as the base theory of the intervention or as an outcome measure of the intervention; (2) they were implemented at nursing homes (or similar setting); (3) they had a narrative activity as its core (as opposed to dancing, gardening or other physical activity); (4) their participants met either physically or nonphysically, ie, via video-conference or the like; and if (5) they targeted residents at a nursing home. The authors systematically appraised the quality of the final selection of studies using the Mixed Methods Assessments Tool (MMAT) version 2011 and did a qualitative synthesis of the final study selection. A total of 10 studies were included. Reminiscence therapy was the most common intervention. Studies also included video-conference, cognitive, and support group interventions. All studies found the social interventions brought about positive trends on either/or the social and health-related measures included. Despite limited and very diverse evidence, our systematic review indicated a positive social and health-related potential of social interventions for older people living in nursing homes or similar institutions.

J	Buckley, H; Nimmon, L				Buckley, Heather; Nimmon, Laura			Learning in Faculty Development: The Role of Social Networks	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article								Purpose Faculty development is increasingly acknowledged as an important aspect of health professions education. Its conceptualization has evolved from an individual skills training activity to contemporary notions that draw on an organizational model. This organizational model recognizes relationships and networks as important mediators of knowledge mobilization. Although such conceptual advancements are critical, we lack empirical evidence and robust insights into how social networks function to shape learning in faculty development. The purpose of this study was to understand how informal professional social networks influence faculty development learning in the health professions. Method This study used a qualitative social network approach to explore how teaching faculty's relationships influenced their learning about teaching. The study was conducted in 2018 in an undergraduate course at a Canadian medical school. Eleven faculty participants were recruited, and 3 methods of data collection were employed: semistructured interviews, participant- drawn sociograms, and demographic questionnaires. Results The social networks of faculty participants influenced their learning about teaching in the following 4 dimensions: enabling and mobilizing knowledge acquisition, shaping identity formation, expressing vulnerability, and scaffolding learning. Conclusions Faculty developers should consider faculty's degree of social embeddedness in their professional social networks, as our study suggests this may influence their learning about teaching. The findings align with recent calls to conceptually reorient faculty development in the health professions as a dynamic social enterprise.

WSCC model use improves health and educational outcomes, but implementation remains a challenge. METHODS Working with 6 schools in 2 districts in the Midwest, we used a mixed-methods approach to determine the people, systems, and messages needed to activate WSCC implementation. We report on social network analysis and message testing findings and research translation to develop the Healthy Schools Toolkit. RESULTS Social networks for both districts included more than 150 individuals. Both demonstrated network densities less than half of the desirable threshold, with evidence of clustering by role and minimal cross-school relationships, posing challenges for WSCC implementation. Across stakeholder groups, messages that emphasize empathy, teamwork, and action were well-received, especially when shared by trusted individuals through communication channels that align with stakeholder needs. CONCLUSIONS The Healthy Schools Toolkit provides an example of a translational product that helps to bridge research with practice. With features that highlight 6 design principles, the toolkit provides complementary activities that schools and districts can use as they plan for integration of the WSCC model.

J	Morris, RL; Sanders, C				Morris, Rebecca L.; Sanders, Caroline			Critical moments in long-term condition management: A longitudinal qualitative social network study	CHRONIC ILLNESS			English	Article						Social networks; longitudinal; qualitative; long-term condition management; UK	CHRONIC ILLNESS; SELF-MANAGEMENT; PEOPLE; HEALTH	Objectives Recent literature has demonstrated the nature and importance of social networks. This study aimed to understand how support needs of people with long-term conditions change over time and how this influences their ability to self-manage. Methods A longitudinal qualitative design was used to explore changes in individual's social networks over a period of year. Thirty participants were recruited and completed initial in-depth face-to-face interviews, telephone follow-ups, and final face-to-face interviews. Results Findings illuminated that changes in health and changes in social networks can influence each other. The social networks implicated in the management of long-term conditions change over time at critical moments and can range between positive and negative reciprocal influences with self-management. Network changes, such as the breaking or reconnecting of ties influenced the context of health management and the degree of engagement with self-management activities. Discussion By examining the specific processes of support and resource provision, this study highlights how overtime the variety of relationships and support available implicated in long-term condition management changes. This has implications for the provision of formal support services and the need for a wider range of support to be identified that recognises change in support requirements as self-management strategies evolve.

Determinants of social participation of visually impaired older adults	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Social participation; Elderly; Low vision; Determinants; Physical health status; Psychosocial factors	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PERCEIVED PARTICIPATION; VISION IMPAIRMENT; PEOPLE; DISABILITY; QUESTIONNAIRE; HEALTH; IMPACT; ISSUES; RESTRICTION	To assess determinants of social participation among visually impaired older adults. This cross-sectional study included visually impaired persons (a parts per thousand yen55 years; n = 173) who were referred to a low-vision rehabilitation center. Determinants (i.e., sociodemographic, physical, social and psychological factors, and personal values) of participation were identified in four domains of participation: (1) domestic life; (2) interpersonal interactions and relationships; (3) major life areas; and (4) community, social, and civic life. Study participants completed telephone interviews. Age, physical fitness, and helplessness were determinants of participation in domestic life. Social network size was associated with participation in major life areas. The personal value attached to participation (i.e., perceived importance) was a determinant of participation in interpersonal interactions and relationships, major life areas, and community, social and civic life. Vision-related characteristics (i.e., self-perceived vision and degree of visual impairment) were not associated with participation. Across the participation domains, perceived importance is a major determinant of social participation among visually impaired older adults. Physical health along with social and psychological status, also affect participation. Knowing how participation is determined can be used to develop rehabilitation interventions to enhance participation of visually impaired older adults.

J	Sun, KY; Chen, J; Viboud, C				Sun, Kaiyuan; Chen, Jenny; Viboud, Cecile			Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article								Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35-60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0.0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5.2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

J	Wailling, JO; Long, JC; Stolarek, I				Wailling, J. O.; Long, Janet C.; Stolarek, Iwona			The context and influences of safety: An exploration of social networks, actions, and behaviour	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article								Background: Safety systems are socio-cultural in nature, characterized by people, their relationships to one another and to the whole. This study aimed to (i) map the social networks of New Zealand's quality improvement and safety leaders, (ii) illuminate influential characteristics and behaviours of key network players and (iii) make recommendations regarding how networks might be optimized. Methods: Instrumental case study was done using mixed methods. Purposeful sampling was applied to collect survey data from delegates at two national safety and quality forums (n=85). Social network questions asked respondents who influenced their safety work. Key network players were identified and invited to participate in a semi-structured interview (n=7). Results: Key players described safety systems in humanistic terms. Safety influence was determined to be a responsive relational process. Adaptive leaders broker relationships between multiple perspectives and contexts, which is essential for safe healthcare. Conclusion: Influential safety approaches appreciate the human contribution to safety. Designing the health system to adapt and respond to the needs of people, teams and communities, rather than the unilateral needs of the system, is essential. Adaptive leadership will assist in achieving these aims and will likely be embraced by New Zealand health professionals.	[Wailling, J.

Access to palliative care for homeless people: complex lives, complex care	BMC PALLIATIVE CARE			English	Article						Palliative care; People experiencing homelessness; End-of-life care; Psychiatric care; Interviews; Qualitative study	OF-LIFE CARE; HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES; HEALTH-CARE; END; MORTALITY; INDIVIDUALS; CHALLENGES; AVOIDANCE; PROVISION; SERVICES	BackgroundPeople experiencing homelessness often encounter progressive incurable somatic diseases in combination with psychiatric and psychosocial problems, and many need palliative care at the end of their lives. Little is known about how palliative care for this group can be started in good time and provided optimally. The objective of this paper is to give insight into the extent people experiencing homelessness have access to good palliative care.MethodsQualitative in-depth interviews were held to reconstruct the cases of 19 people experiencing homelessness in the Netherlands. Eight cases concerned persons being in the palliative phase (using the surprise question) and the other 11 cases concerned persons recently died after a period of ill health due to somatic illness. We used purposive sampling until data saturation was reached. The total number of interviews was 52. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed inductively.ResultsThree key themes were: late access', capricious trajectory' and complex care'. The first key theme refers to the often delayed start of palliative care, because of the difficulties in recognizing the need for palliative care, the ambivalence of people experiencing homelessness about accepting palliative care, and the lack of facilities with specific expertise in palliative care for them. The second key theme refers to the illness trajectory, which is often capricious because of the challenging behaviour of people experiencing homelessness, an unpredictable disease process and a system not being able to accommodate or meet their needs. The third key theme refers to the complexity of their care with regard to pain and symptom control, psychosocial and spiritual aspects, and the social network.ConclusionsThe care for in the palliative phase does not satisfy the core requirements of palliative care since there are bottlenecks regarding timely identification, the social network, and the assessment and management of physical symptoms and psychosocial and spiritual care needs. Education in palliative care of outreach professionals, training staff in shelters in the provision of palliative care, and building a network of palliative care specialists for people experiencing homelessness.

Analysis of the US patient referral network	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						generative model; hierarchical modeling; network science; physician network; shared patient network; social network analysis	SHARING NETWORKS; PRIMARY-CARE; COLLABORATION; PHYSICIAN; QUALITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; DYNAMICS; COST	In this paper, we analyze the US Patient Referral Network (also called the Shared Patient Network) and various subnetworks for the years 2009 to 2015. In these networks, two physicians are linked if a patient encounters both of them within a specified time interval, according to the data made available by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We find power law distributions on most state-level data as well as a core-periphery structure. On a national and state level, we discover a so-called small-world structure as well as a gravity law of the type found in some large-scale economic networks. Some physicians play the role of hubs for interstate referral. Strong correlations between certain network statistics with health care system statistics at both the state and national levels are discovered. The patterns in the referral network evinced using several statistical analyses involving key metrics derived from the network illustrate the potential for using network analysis to provide new insights into the health care system and opportunities or mechanisms for catalyzing improvements.

J	Suarez-Lledo, V; Alvarez-Galvez, J				Suarez-Lledo, Victor; Alvarez-Galvez, Javier			Prevalence of Health Misinformation on Social Media: Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Review						social media; health misinformation; infodemiology; infodemics; social networks; poor quality information; social contagion	HPV VACCINE COVERAGE; WORLD-WIDE-WEB; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES; ZIKA VIRUS; INFORMATION; TWITTER; YOUTUBE; VIDEOS; SPREAD	Background: Although at present there is broad agreement among researchers, health professionals, and policy makers on the need to control and combat health misinformation, the magnitude of this problem is still unknown. Consequently, it is fundamental to discover both the most prevalent health topics and the social media platforms from which these topics are initially framed and subsequently disseminated. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify the main health misinformation topics and their prevalence on different social media platforms, focusing on methodological quality and the diverse solutions that are being implemented to address this public health concern. Methods: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published in English before March 2019, with a focus on the study of health misinformation in social media. We defined health misinformation as a health-related claim that is based on anecdotal evidence, false, or misleading owing to the lack of existing scientific knowledge. We included (1) articles that focused on health misinformation in social media, including those in which the authors discussed the consequences or purposes of health misinformation and (2) studies that described empirical findings regarding the measurement of health misinformation on these platforms. Results: A total of 69 studies were identified as eligible, and they covered a wide range of health topics and social media platforms. The topics were articulated around the following six principal categories: vaccines (32%), drugs or smoking (22%), noncommunicable diseases (19%), pandemics (10%), eating disorders (9%), and medical treatments (7%). Studies were mainly based on the following five methodological approaches: social network analysis (28%), evaluating content (26%), evaluating quality (24%), content/text analysis (16%), and sentiment analysis (6%). Health misinformation was most prevalent in studies related to smoking products and drugs such as opioids and marijuana. Posts with misinformation reached 87% in some studies. Health misinformation about vaccines was also very common (43%), with the human papilloma virus vaccine being the most affected. Health misinformation related to diets or pro-eating disorder arguments were moderate in comparison to the aforementioned topics (36%). Studies focused on diseases (ie, noncommunicable diseases and pandemics) also reported moderate misinformation rates (40%), especially in the case of cancer. Finally, the lowest levels of health misinformation were related to medical treatments (30%). Conclusions: The prevalence of health misinformation was the highest on Twitter and on issues related to smoking products and drugs. However, misinformation on major public health issues, such as vaccines and diseases, was also high. Our study offers a comprehensive characterization of the dominant health misinformation topics and a comprehensive description of their prevalence on different social media platforms, which can guide future studies and help in the development of evidence-based digital policy action plans.

Social network analysis (SNA) has the potential to augment our understanding of KT success by applying a network lens that examines the influence of relationships and social structures on research use and intervention acceptability by health professionals. The purpose of this review was to comprehensively map the ways in which SNA methodologies have been applied to the study of KT with respect to health professional networks.MethodsSystematic scoping review methodology involved searching five academic databases for primary research on KT that employed quantitative SNA methods, and inclusion screening using predetermined criteria. Data extraction included information on study aim, population, variables, network properties, theory use, and data collection methods. Descriptive statistics and chronology charting preceded theoretical analysis of findings.ResultsTwenty-seven retained articles describing 19 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies reported on 28 structural properties, with degree centrality, tie characteristics (e.g., homophily, reciprocity), and whole network density being most frequent. Eleven studies examined physician-only networks, 9 focused on interprofessional networks, and 1 reported on a nurse practitioner network. Diffusion of innovation, social contagion, and social influence theories were most commonly applied.ConclusionsEmerging interest in SNA for KT- and implementation-related research is evident. The included articles focused on individual level evidence-based decision-making: we recommend also applying SNA to meso- or macro-level KT activities. SNA research that expands the range of professions under study, examines network dynamics over time, extends the depth of analysis of the role of network structure on KT processes and outcomes, and employs mixed methods to triangulate findings, is needed to advance the field. SNA is a valuable approach for evaluating key network characteristics, structures and positions of relevance to KT, implementation, and evidence informed practice. Examining how network structure influences connections and the implications of those holding prominent network positions can provide insights to improve network-based KT processes.

For example, in online depression communities, patients can share their experiences, exchange valuable information, and receive emotional support to help them cope with their disease. Therefore, it is critical to understand how patients with depression develop online social support networks to exchange informational and emotional support. Objective: Our aim in this study was to investigate which user attributes have significant effects on the formation of informational and emotional support networks in online depression communities and to further examine whether there is an association between the two social networks. Methods: We used social network theory and constructed exponential random graph models to help understand the informational and emotional support networks in online depression communities. A total of 74,986 original posts were retrieved from 1077 members in an online depression community in China from April 2003 to September 2017 and the available data were extracted. An informational support network of 1077 participant nodes and 6557 arcs and an emotional support network of 1077 participant nodes and 6430 arcs were constructed to examine the endogenous (purely structural) effects and exogenous (actor-relation) effects on each support network separately, as well as the cross-network effects between the two networks. Results: We found significant effects of two important structural features, reciprocity and transitivity, on the formation of both the informational support network (r=3.6247, P<.001, and r=1.6232, P<.001, respectively) and the emotional support network (r=4.4111, P<.001, and r=0.0177, P<.001, respectively). The results also showed significant effects of some individual factors on the formation of the two networks. No significant effects of homophily were found for gender (r=0.0783, P=.20, and r=0.1122, P=.25, respectively) in the informational or emotional support networks. There was no tendency for users who had great influence (r=0.3253, P=.05) or wrote more posts (r=0.3896, P=.07) or newcomers (r=-0.0452, P=.66) to form informational support ties more easily. However, users who spent more time online (r=0.6680, P<.001) or provided more replies to other posts (r=0.5026, P<.001) were more likely to form informational support ties. Users who had a big influence (r=0.8325, P<.001), spent more time online (r=0.5839, P<.001), wrote more posts (r=2.4025, P<.001), or provided more replies to other posts (r=0.2259, P<.001) were more likely to form emotional support ties, and newcomers (r=-0.4224, P<.001) were less likely than old-timers to receive emotional support. In addition, we found that there was a significant entrainment effect (r=0.7834, P<.001) and a nonsignificant exchange effect (r=-0.2757, P=.32) between the two networks. Conclusions: This study makes several important theoretical contributions to the research on online depression communities and has important practical implications for the managers of online depression communities and the users involved in these communities.

Large datasets such as World Health Organization (WHO) statistics are collected less than once per year, whereas social network platforms, such as Twitter, offer the opportunity for real-time analysis of expressed mood. Such patterns are valuable to the mental health research community, to help understand the periods and locations of greatest demand and unmet need. We describe the "We Feel" system for analyzing global and regional variations in emotional expression, and report the results of validation against known patterns of variation in mood. 2.73 x 10(9) emotional tweets were collected over a 12-week period, and automatically annotated for emotion, geographic location, and gender. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the data illustrated a dominant in-phase pattern across all emotions, modulated by antiphase patterns for "positive" and "negative" emotions. The first three principal components accounted for over 90% of the variation in the data. PCA was also used to remove the dominant diurnal and weekly variations allowing identification of significant events within the data, with z-scores showing expression of emotions over 80 standard deviations from the mean. We also correlate emotional expression with WHO data at a national level and although no correlations were observed for the burden of depression, the burden of anxiety and suicide rates appeared to correlate with expression of particular emotions.

J	Willis, CD; Mitton, C; Gordon, J; Best, A				Willis, Cameron D.; Mitton, Craig; Gordon, Jason; Best, Allan			System tools for system change	BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY			English	Review							MARGINAL ANALYSIS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; NETWORK ANALYSIS; MENTAL-HEALTH; NEW-ZEALAND; CARE; DYNAMICS; COLLABORATION; KNOWLEDGE; SERVICES	Background: Health system transformations are influenced by dynamic relationships within and between individuals and institutions, as well as political, educational and legislative factors. This article aims to promote awareness of five tools that recognise this complexity and that are proposed to have value for decision makers: concept mapping, social network analysis, system dynamics modelling, programme budgeting and marginal analysis, and the tools for knowledge management and translation. Methods: The authors briefly describe the methodological approach of each tool, provide a commentary on the conditions in which these tools have been employed, and discuss their impact on the processes and outcomes of system transformation. An international advisory panel was convened based on a combination of experience, expertise and perspective. The panel assisted in synthesising the evidence relating to each tool and, in partnership with the authors, refined the interpretation of the role and value of each tool for system transformation. Findings: The tools discussed may impact the structural and procedural outcomes of transformation as well as the values, behaviours and attitudes of people undergoing change. The techniques described provide those undertaking transformation with methods to negotiate clinical, academic, political, organisational and cultural perspectives, and recognise the pivotal role of context in transformation. Conclusions: This review offers a novel synthesis of how these tools may add value to decision making for health policy. The tools discussed, while not a panacea to the challenges of large system change, provide methods that acknowledge the complexity of the transformative challenge and present innovative paths to co-produced solutions.

J	Wen, D; Zhang, X; Lei, J				Wen, Dong; Zhang, Xingting; Lei, Jianbo			Consumers' perceived attitudes to wearable devices in health monitoring in China: A survey study	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Perception; Wearable devices; Health monitoring; Survey study	MOBILE HEALTH	Background and Objective: Capital market and consumer market interest in wearable devices has surged in recent years, however, their actual acceptance in the field of health monitoring is somewhat not as expected. This study aims to understand the perceptions of wearable devices of general consumers, analyze the review of the devices by users, and find existing problems associated with current wearable devices. Methods: Sojump.com, an on-line questionnaire tool, was used to generate the questionnaire, which focused on four aspects. The snowball sampling method was employed to collect questionnaires by making use of the author's social network. Results: (1) A total of 2058 valid questionnaires were received from the respondents from every province in China; of the respondents, 52.4% have used a wearable device. (2) The respondents had a low level of knowledge about wearable devices (2.79/5) but were optimistic with regard to the devices' future (3.86/5), and 84% recognized an acceptable price of less than 2000 RMB. Nearly half of the respondents were unwilling to continuously wear the device (47.1%) and share their health data (44.7%). (3) The functions of wearable devices that the respondents expected were mainly health management (63.5%), mobile phone accessories (61.9%), and location tracking (61.2%), and the promising hot future functions were mainly data analysis (74.2%), exercise coaching (60.5%), and child tracking (58.8%). Regarding the health monitoring functions, the respondents were most interested in heart health monitoring. (4) The respondents had different levels of emphasis regarding the existing problems of wearable devices at different use stages. Being easily damaged or lost (49.7%), being incapable of providing health recommendations based on data analysis (46.7%), and being uncomfortable to wear (45.8%) likely lead consumers to abandon the use of wearable devices. Conclusions: Consumers are optimistic about the prospects of wearable devices; however, there is a large gap between the reliability of the measurement data, the ease of use, and the interpretation of measurement data of current wearable products and consumer expectations. Consumer demand for health management functions is higher than that for daily auxiliary-type functions, which is an issue that should be properly addressed and resolved by manufacturers.

J	Leech, T; Dorstyn, DS; Li, WJ				Leech, Teghan; Dorstyn, Diana S.; Li, Wenjing			eMental health service use among Australian youth: a cross-sectional survey framed by Andersen's model	AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW			English	Article							E-MENTAL HEALTH; HELP-SEEKING; SOCIAL SUPPORT; MEDICAL-CARE; ACCESS; DEPRESSION	Objective Young adults aged 18-24 years often delay or avoid seeking help for their mental health concerns. eMental health, the use of the Internet to deliver mental health information, services and care, offers a low-cost, easy-access option. However the factors that influence online help-seeking among this cohort remain unclear. Methods Andersen's healthcare utilisation model was adapted to examine correlates of eMental health use among Australian youth. In all, 161 young adults completed an online survey comprising sociodemographic questions, online feature preferences, the Actual and General Help-seeking Questionnaires, Berkman-Syme Social Network Index, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Service Obstacles Scale and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales. Results Almost 70% of young people reported having previously accessed some form of online support for their personal or emotional problems. This included informal information via social media and formalised counselling services. Notably, perception of service satisfaction was low. Hierarchical logistical regression identified two significant predisposing factors to subsequent online help-seeking: prior face-to-face service use and living or cohabitating with others. Conclusions eMental health is accessed by young people in Australia, yet more needs to be done to better integrate this service model into the healthcare system. This includes training and education for consumers and professionals about existing, effective programs. What is known about this topic? eMental health platforms can bridge the gap between technology and conventional mental health care. Despite its rapidly expanding evidence base, the implementation of eMental health into the Australian healthcare system remains slow. More work needs to be done to elucidate the factors underlying preferences for online help-seeking. What does this paper add? Young adult perspectives on the delivery of mental health information, services and care via the Internet are examined in accordance with a major conceptual model, namely Andersen's behavioural model of health services use. The majority of those surveyed reported having accessed some form of online support for an emotional issue, although dissatisfaction with the quality of this support was expressed. Andersen's model can guide future research in this area and potentially help target eMental health initiatives to individual service users' needs. What are the implications for practitioners? eMental health interventions offer an alternative for young adults who have difficulty accessing traditional mental health care services, but are also an adjunct to those experiencing mild to moderate symptoms of mental illness. Practitioners can introduce young adults to eMental health by discussing the benefits and limitations and by providing information about available and secure online programs delivered by trusted service providers.

J	Di Vincenzo, F				Di Vincenzo, Fausto			Exploring the networking behaviors of hospital organizations	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Networking behavior; Hospital organizations; Patient transfer; Social network analysis	INTERHOSPITAL COLLABORATION; PATIENT-TRANSFERS; CARE	Background: Despite an extensive body of knowledge exists on network outcomes and on how hospital network structures may contribute to the creation of outcomes at different levels of analysis, less attention has been paid to understanding how and why hospital organizational networks evolve and change. The aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of networking behaviors of hospital organizations. Methods: Stochastic actor-based model for network dynamics was used to quantitatively examine data covering six-years of patient transfer relations among 35 hospital organizations. Specifically, the study investigated about determinants of patient transfer evolution modeling partner selection choice as a combination of multiple organizational attributes and endogenous network-based processes. Results: The results indicate that having overlapping specialties and treating patients with the same case-mix decrease the likelihood of observing network ties between hospitals. Also, results revealed as geographical proximity and membership of the same LHA have a positive impact on the networking behavior of hospitals organizations, there is a propensity in the network to choose larger hospitals as partners, and to transfer patients between hospitals facing similar levels of operational uncertainty. Conclusions: Organizational attributes (overlapping specialties and case-mix), institutional factors (LHA), and geographical proximity matter in the formation and shaping of hospital networks over time. Managers can benefit from the use of these findings by clearly identifying the role and strategic positioning of their hospital with respect to the entire network. Social network analysis can yield novel information and also aid policy makers in the formation of interventions, encouraging alliances among providers as well as planning health system restructuring.

Social consequences of advanced cancer in patients and their informal caregivers: a qualitative study	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Social well-being; Social consequences; Advanced cancer; Palliative oncology; Informal caregivers; Focus groups	OF-LIFE; BREAST-CANCER; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; YOUNG-ADULTS; BURDEN; HEALTH; SUPPORT; ADOLESCENTS; EXPERIENCES; IMPACT	PurposeCancer threatens the social well-being of patients and their informal caregivers. Social life is even more profoundly affected in advanced diseases, but research on social consequences of advanced cancer is scarce. This study aims to explore social consequences of advanced cancer as experienced by patients and their informal caregivers.MethodsSeven focus groups and seven in-depth semi-structured interviews with patients (n=18) suffering from advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (n=15) were conducted. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and open coded using a thematic analysis approach.ResultsSocial consequences were categorized in three themes: social engagement, social identity, and social network. Regarding social engagement, patients and informal caregivers said that they strive for normality by continuing their life as prior to the diagnosis, but experienced barriers in doing so. Regarding social identity, patients and informal caregivers reported feelings of social isolation. The social network became more transparent, and the value of social relations had increased since the diagnosis. Many experienced positive and negative shifts in the quantity and quality of their social relations.ConclusionsSocial consequences of advanced cancer are substantial. There appears to be a great risk of social isolation in which responses from social relations play an important role. Empowering patients and informal caregivers to discuss their experienced social consequences is beneficial. Creating awareness among healthcare professionals is essential as they provide social support and anticipate on social problems. Finally, educating social relations regarding the impact of advanced cancer and effective support methods may empower social support systems and reduce feelings of isolation.

J	Shin, JY; Choi, SW				Shin, Ji Youn; Choi, Sung Won			Online interventions geared toward increasing resilience and reducing distress in family caregivers	CURRENT OPINION IN SUPPORTIVE AND PALLIATIVE CARE			English	Review						cancer; family caregiver; mHealth; online interventions; stress; wellbeing	MENTAL-HEALTH; CANCER; CARE; SUPPORT; INFORMATION; CHILDREN; QUALITY; PATIENT; STRESS; NEEDS	Purpose of review Family caregivers of patients with cancer often spend a great deal of effort on physically and emotionally demanding work while taking care of patients. However, the majority of caregivers are not properly equipped for their role as caregivers, which may lead to increased distress in both caregivers and patients. Herein, we reviewed the recent literature (last 3 years) examining online interventions that seek to support caregiver resilience and decrease distress. Recent findings Our search identified interventions involving three main themes: informational support, positive activities, and social support. These are mostly in the form of web-based tools and mobile apps targeting both usability and quality of life. Social network services are also considered in this review as a new environment for caregivers to connect with other individuals with lived experience in similar circumstances. Summary Existing studies on online interventions to support caregivers is still at a formative development stage and pilot tests of feasibility, rather than a substantive body of randomized controlled trials to assess the impact in different user populations, or to determine specific factors that impact caregiver distress level or resilience. More research is needed to further assess the long-term effects of online interventions on caregiver stress and resilience. Also, the role of different types of social network services and new forms of interaction, such as conversational agents, has not yet been fully investigated in caregiver populations. Future research should strive to seek new modes of providing services that may present novel opportunities to enhance caregiver resilience and reduce distress.

J	Park, SH; Hong, SH				Park, So Hyun; Hong, Song Hee			Identification of Primary Medication Concerns Regarding Thyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy From Online Patient Medication Reviews: Text Mining of Social Network Data	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						medication counseling; social network data; primary medication concerns; satisfaction with levothyroxine treatment	THYROXINE; LIFE	Background: Patients with hypothyroidism report poor health-related quality of life despite having undergone thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT). Understanding patient concerns regarding levothyroxine can help improve the treatment outcomes of THRT. Objective: This study aimed to (1) identify the distinctive themes in patient concerns regarding THRT, (2) determine whether patients have unique primary medication concerns specific to their demographics, and (3) determine the predictability of primary medication concerns on patient treatment satisfaction. Methods: We collected patient reviews from WebMD in the United States (1037 reviews about generic levothyroxine and 1075 reviews about the brand version) posted between September 1, 2007, and January 30, 2017. We used natural language processing to identify the themes of medication concerns. Multiple regression analyses were conducted in order to examine the predictability of the primary medication concerns on patient treatment satisfaction. Results: Natural language processing of the patient reviews of levothyroxine posted on a social networking site produced 6 distinctive themes of patient medication concerns related to levothyroxine treatment: how to take the drug, treatment initiation, dose adjustment, symptoms of pain, generic substitutability, and appearance. Patients had different primary medication concerns unique to their gender, age, and treatment duration. Furthermore, treatment satisfaction on levothyroxine depended on what primary medication concerns the patient had. Conclusions: Natural language processing of text content available on social media could identify different themes of patient medication concerns that can be validated in future studies to inform the design of tailored medication counseling for improved patient treatment satisfaction.

Traditional methods for observing human sexual behavior typically adopt manual intervention approaches (eg, interviews). However, the data obtained by such traditional approaches suffer from intrinsic bias and limited sample sizes. Sexual behavioral data that are more reflective of the actual situation can be collected by equipping sex toys with sensors. Objective: To address the limitations of traditional human sexual behavior data observation methods, a novel cyberphysical system is proposed to capture natural human sexual behavior data in China at the nationwide level. Methods: A cyberphysical human sexual behavior acquisition system (SeBA) was designed and implemented. SeBA jointly utilizes state of the art information and communication technologies such as smart sex toys, smartphones, and mobile social networks. Smart sex toys enable objective collection of data on human sexual behavior, while the mobile social network provides the possibility of partnered sex in a cyberphysical manner. The objectives and function settings are discussed, and the overall framework of the system architecture is presented. Results: Operation and privacy policies are proposed and the technical solution of SeBA is described. The effectiveness of SeBA was verified based on analysis of users' human sexual behavior data collected from January 2016 to June 2017. A total of 103,424 solo sexual behaviors were recorded involving 13,047 users, and 61,007 partnered sexual behaviors from 7,140 users were observed. The proportions of males and females in the solo and partnered sex groups were fairly consistent with recent statistics on unmarried individuals in China. We also found that only a small portion of individuals provided information on at least one other attribute besides the required input of gender, such as age, height, location, job, sex preferences, purposes, and interests. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze objective human sexual behavior data at the nationwide level. Although the data are restricted to China, this study can provide insight for further research on human sexual behavior based on the huge amount of data available from wireless smart sex toys worldwide. It is anticipated that findings from such objective big data analyses can help deepen our understanding of sexual behavior, as well as improve sexual health and sexual wellness.

As part of this phenomenon, social networks have attained a prominent role in health care. A variety of medical services is provided over the Internet, including home monitoring, interactive communications between the patient and service providers, and social support, among others. This study emphasizes some of the practical implications of Web-based health social networks for patients and for health care systems. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess how participation in a social network among individuals with a chronic condition contributed to patient activation, based on the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional survey with a retrospective component was conducted. Data were collected from Camoni, a Hebrew-language Web-based social health network, participants in the diabetes mellitus, pain, hypertension, and depression/anxiety forums, during November 2012 to 2013. Experienced users (enrolled at least 6 months) and newly enrolled received similar versions of the same questionnaire including sociodemographics and PAM. Results: Among 686 participants, 154 of 337 experienced and 123 of 349 newly enrolled completed the questionnaire. Positive correlations (P<.05) were found between frequency and duration of site visits and patient activation, social relationships, and chronic disease knowledge. Men surfed longer than women (chi(2)(3) = 10.104, P<.05). Experienced users with diabetes surfed more than those with other illnesses and had significantly higher PAM scores (mean, M=69.3, standard deviation, SD=19.1, PAM level 4; Z=-4.197, P<.001) than new users (M=62.8, SD=18.7, PAM level 3). Disease knowledge directly predicted PAM for all users (beta=.26 and .21, respectively). Frequency and duration of social health network use were correlated with increased knowledge about a chronic disease. Experienced surfers had higher PAM than newly enrolled, suggesting that continued site use may contribute to increased activation. Conclusions: Web-based social health networks offer an opportunity to expand patient knowledge and increase involvement in personal health, thereby increasing patient activation. Further studies are needed to examine these changes on other aspects of chronic illnesses such as quality of life and costs.

A growing body of evidence points to the need for putting power relations at the forefront of understanding and operationalizing citizen-led accountability, rather than technical tools and best practices. In this study, we apply a network lens to the question of how initiatives build collective power to redress health system failures affecting marginalized communities in three municipalities in Guatemala. Methods Network mapping and interpretive discussions were used to examine relational qualities of citizen-led initiatives' networks and explore the resources they offer for mobilizing action and influencing health accountability. Participants in the municipal-level initiatives responded to a social network analysis questionnaire focused on their ties of communication and collaboration with other initiative participants and their interactions with authorities regarding health system problems. Discussions with participants about the maps generated enriched our view of what the ties represented and their history of collective action and also provided space for planning action to strengthen their networks. Results Our findings indicate that network qualities like cohesiveness and centralization reflected the initiative participants' agency in adapting to their sociopolitical context, and participants' social positions were a key resource in providing connection to a broad base of support for mobilizing collective action to document health service deficiencies and advocate for solutions. Their legitimacy as "representatives of the people" enabled them to engage with authorities from a bolstered position of power, and their iterative interactions with authorities further contributed to develop their advocacy capabilities and resulted in accountability gains. Conclusions Our study provided evidence to counter the tendency to underestimate the assets and capabilities that marginalized citizens have for building power, and affirmed the idea that best-fit, with-the-grain approaches are well-suited for highly unequal settings characterized by weak governance. Efforts to support and understand change processes in citizen-led initiatives should include focus on adaptive network building to enable contextually-embedded approaches that leverage the collective power of the users of health services and grassroots leaders on the frontlines of accountability.

An Open Architecture to Support Social and Health Services in a Smart TV Environment	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Digital TV; multimedia computing; senior adults; smart homes; social implication of technology	FALL DETECTION SYSTEM; AGING-IN-PLACE; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; HOME; INFORMATICS; DETECTOR; IMPACT; ADULTS; CARE	Objective: To design, implement, and test a solution to provide social and health services for the elderly at home based on smart TV technologies and access to all services. Methods: The architecture proposed is based on an open software platform and standard personal computing hardware. This provides great flexibility to develop new applications over the underlying infrastructure or to integrate new devices, for instance to monitor a broad range of vital signs in those cases where home monitoring is required. Results: An actual system as a proof-of-conceptwas designed, implemented, and deployed. Applications range from social network clients to vital signs monitoring; from interactive TV contests to conventional online care applications such as medication reminders or telemedicine. Conclusion: In both cases, the results have been very positive, confirming the initial perception of the TV as a convenient, easy-to-use technology to provide social and health care. The TV set is a much more familiar computing interface for most senior users, and as a consequence, smart TVs become a most convenient solution for the design and implementation of applications and services targeted to this user group. Significance: This proposal has been tested in real setting with 62 senior people at their homes. Users included both individuals with experience using computers and others reluctant to them.

J	Ganguli, I; Thompson, RW; Ferris, TG				Ganguli, Ishani; Thompson, Ryan W.; Ferris, Timothy G.			What can five high cost patients teach us about healthcare spending?	HEALTHCARE-THE JOURNAL OF DELIVERY SCIENCE AND INNOVATION			English	Article							LONG-TERM TRENDS; CASE-MANAGEMENT; UNITED-STATES; SERVICE USE; CONTINUITY; ACTIVATION; QUALITY; SYSTEM; TRIAL; TRUST	The highest cost patients account for a disproportionately large share of American healthcare costs and are increasingly the focus of research and policy efforts to stem the rapid growth of these costs. These patients tend to be medically complex and frail, but we know little about how such characteristics influence healthcare spending from the perspectives of the patients and their caregivers. Therefore, we examined five of the highest cost patients at an academic medical center in a case series. We interviewed the patients, their family members, and their clinicians and analyzed their claims data and medical charts to explore how patient and health system characteristics influenced their health costs. We found that their complex medical issues, physical disability/frailty, and mental illness/substance use seemed to be linked with increased costs, while their socioeconomic status, social network, activation, and trust in clinicians and the health system appeared to increase or decrease costs depending on context. In these patients' narratives, trust seemed to modify the interaction between patient activation and cost. Our observations raise questions about whether factors mediating costs in high-cost patients may be more heterogenous than previously described and if patient trust and activation may be important, potentially modifiable drivers of these costs. Our case series illustrates the challenges of unilateral policies to address high cost patients and the need for targeted approaches.

Methods: The current study involved a systematic review of all studies that have investigated the nature of participation in an online health community and have provided a quantifiable method for categorizing a person based on their participation style. A systematic search yielded 20 papers. Results: Participatory styles were classified as either multidimensional (based on multiple metrics) or unidimensional (based on one metric). With respect to the multidimensional category, a total of 41 different participation styles were identified ranging from Influential Users who were leaders on the board to Topic-Focused Responders who focused on a specific topic and tended to respond to rather than initiate posts. However, there was little overlap in participation styles identified both across OHCs for different health conditions and within OHCs for specific health conditions. Five of the 41 styles emerged in more than one study (Hubs, Authorities, Facilitators, Prime Givers, and Discussants), but the remainder were reported in only one study. The focus of the unidimensional studies was on level of engagement and particularly on high-engaged users. Eight different metrics were used to evaluate level of engagement with the greatest focus on frequency of posts. Conclusions: With the exception of high-engaged users based on high post frequency, the current review found little evidence for consistent participatory styles across different health communities. However, this area of research is in its infancy, with most of the studies included in the review being published in the last 2 years. Nevertheless, the review delivers a nomenclature for OHC participation styles and metrics and discusses important methodological issues that will provide a basis for future comparative research in the area. Further studies are required to systematically investigate a range of participatory styles, to investigate their association with different types of online health communities and to determine the contribution of different participatory styles within and across online health communities.

Such measures are expected to have consequences on mental health. Aims: In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of quarantine-related anxiety and its socioeconomic correlates. Methods: An online questionnaire was utilized to collect information about quarantine-related anxiety and related factors from a non-representative sample of Jordanian population in March 2020. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used to ascertain the level of stress. Using STATA 16, multivariable ordinal logistic regression was done to estimate beta-coefficient (beta) and corresponding 95% CI of the anxiety level. Results: Overall, 5274 participants returned the survey. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety was 21.5%, 10.9%, and 6%, respectively. Female gender (beta=0.47, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.59) and more members of the household (beta=0.04, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.07) were correlated with a higher degree of anxiety, while older age (beta=-0.27, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.20), having larger social network (beta=-0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.13), social support (beta=-0.28, 95% CI: -0.32 to -0.23), and higher income (>2000 Jordanian Dinars vs reference, beta=-0.52, 95% CI: -0.71 to -0.33) were correlated with lower BAI scores. Conclusion: Our findings showed that approximately four out of every ten participants experienced quarantine-related anxiety. Younger participants, women, and people with poor social support were more likely to experience quarantine-related anxiety. These findings highlight the importance of targeting these groups to mitigate the consequence of home quarantine on public health.

Physician Patient-sharing Networks and the Cost and Intensity of Care in US Hospitals	MEDICAL CARE			English	Article						health care costs; network analysis; primary care; health care systems; hospitals; health care variation	SOCIAL NETWORK; QUALITY; CONTINUITY; HEALTH; LIFE	Background: There is substantial variation in the cost and intensity of care delivered by US hospitals. We assessed how the structure of patient-sharing networks of physicians affiliated with hospitals might contribute to this variation. Methods: We constructed hospital-based professional networks based on patient-sharing ties among 61,461 physicians affiliated with 528 hospitals in 51 hospital referral regions in the US using Medicare data on clinical encounters during 2006. We estimated linear regression models to assess the relationship between measures of hospital network structure and hospital measures of spending and care intensity in the last 2 years of life. Results: The typical physician in an average-sized urban hospital was connected to 187 other doctors for every 100 Medicare patients shared with other doctors. For the average-sized urban hospital an increase of 1 standard deviation (SD) in the median number of connections per physician was associated with a 17.8% increase in total spending, in addition to 17.4% more hospital days, and 23.8% more physician visits (all P < 0.001). In addition, higher "centrality" of primary care providers within these hospital networks was associated with 14.7% fewer medical specialist visits (P < 0.001) and lower spending on imaging and tests (-9.2% and -12.9% for 1 SD increase in centrality, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Hospital-based physician network structure has a significant relationship with an institution's care patterns for their patients. Hospitals with doctors who have higher numbers of connections have higher costs and more intensive care, and hospitals with primary care-centered networks have lower costs and care intensity.

Decades into the HIV epidemic, the relationships that YMSM-serving health and social organizations have with one another has not been studied in depth. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the competition, collaboration, and funding source structures of multiplex organization networks and the mechanisms that promote fruitful relationships among these organizations. Research Design: The study data collection method was a survey of health and social organizations from 2013-2014 in 2 cities, Chicago, IL and Houston, TX. Subjects: Study participants were representatives from 138 health and social organizations. Measures: Responses to survey questions were used to reconstruct competition, collaboration, and combined competition-collaboration networks. Results: While taking into consideration the collaborative relationships among organizations, we provide statistical evidence that organizations of similar type, similar social media use patterns, comparable patterns of funding, and similar network contexts tended to compete with one another. This competition was less likely to be accompanied by any sort of collaboration if the organizations shared common funding sources. Conclusions: Competition that excludes potential collaboration may be detrimental to mobilizing the collective efforts that serve local YMSM communities. System-level interventions may provide promising approaches to scaling-up HIV prevention and treatment efforts so as to encourage organizations to form partnerships with otherwise competing providers.

Methods: Managers and professional consultants of a public health department serving a large urban population named whom they turned to for help, whom they considered experts in evidence-informed practice, and whom they considered friends. Multilevel regression analysis and exponential random graph modeling were used to predict the formation of information seeking and expertise-recognition connections by personal characteristics of the seeker and source, and the structural attributes of the social networks. Results: The respondents were more likely to recognize the members of the supervisory/administrative division as experts. The extent to which an individual implemented evidence-based practice (EBP) principles in daily practice was a significant predictor of both being an information source and being recognized as expert by peers. Friendship was a significant predictor of both information seeking and expertise-recognition connections. Conclusion: The analysis showed a communication network segregated by organizational divisions. Managers were identified frequently as information sources, even though this is not a part of their formal role. Self-perceived implementation of EBP in practice was a significant predictor of being an information source or an expert, implying a positive atmosphere towards implementation of evidence-informed decision making in this public health organization. Results also implied that the perception of accessibility and trust were significant predictors of expertise recognition.

J	Khan, A; Uddin, S; Srinivasan, U				Khan, Arif; Uddin, Shahadat; Srinivasan, Uma			Comorbidity network for chronic disease: A novel approach to understand type 2 diabetes progression	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Health informatics; Chronic disease; Comorbidity; Diabetes; Type 2 diabetes; Network theory; Social network analysis; Electronic health records; Knowledge management; Data mining; Attribution	PREVALENCE; MELLITUS; CARE; INFORMATICS; ICD-9-CM; OBESITY	Background: Chronic diseases management outside expensive hospital settings has become a major target for governments, funders and healthcare service providers. It is well known that chronic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) do not occur in isolation, and has a shared aetiology common to many other diseases and disorders. Diabetes Australia reports that it is associated with a myriad of complications, which affect the feet, eyes, kidneys, and cardiovascular health. For instance, nerve damage in the lower limbs affects around 13% of Australians with diabetes, diabetic retinopathy occurs in over 15% of Australians with diabetes, and diabetes is now the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Our research focus is therefore to understand the comorbidity pattern, which in turn can enhance our understanding of the multifactorial risk factors of chronic diseases like Type 2 Diabetes. Our research approach is based on utilising valuable indicators present in pre-existing administrative healthcare data, which are routinely collected but often neglected in health research. One such administrative healthcare data is the hospital admission and discharge data that carries information about diagnoses, which are represented in the form of ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Analysis of diagnoses codes and their relationships helps us construct comorbidity networks which can provide insights that can be used to understand chronic disease progression pattern and comorbidity network at a population level. This understanding can subsequently enable healthcare providers to formulate appropriate preventive health policies targeted to address high-risk chronic conditions. Methods and findings: The research utilises network theory principles applied to administrative healthcare data. Given the high rate of prevalence, we selected Type 2 Diabetes as the exemplar chronic disease. We have developed a research framework to understand and represent the progression of Type 2 diabetes, utilising graph theory and social network analysis techniques. We propose the concept of a 'comorbidity network' that can effectively model chronic disease comorbidities and their transition patterns, thereby representing the chronic disease progression. We further take the attribution effect of the comorbidities into account while generating the network; that is, we not only look at the pattern of disease in chronic disease patients, but also compare the disease pattern with that of non-chronic patients, to understand which comorbidities have a higher influence on the chronic disease pathway. The research framework enables us to construct a baseline comorbidity network for each of the two cohorts. It then compares and merges these two networks into single comorbidity network to discover the comorbidities that are exclusive to diabetic patients. This framework was applied on administrative data drawn from the Australian healthcare context. The overall dataset contained approximately 1.4 million admission records from 0.75 million patients, from which we filtered and sampled the records of 2300 diabetics and 2300 non-diabetic patients. We found significant difference in the health trajectory of diabetic and non-diabetic cohorts. The diabetic cohort exhibited more comorbidity prevalence and denser network properties. For example, in the diabetic cohort, heart and liver-related disorders, cataract etc. were more prevalent. Over time, the prevalence of diseases in the health trajectory of diabetic cohorts were almost double of the prevalence in the non-diabetic cohort, indicating entirely different ways of disease progression. Conclusions: The paper presents a research framework based on network theory to understand chronic disease progression along with associated comorbidities that manifest over time. The analysis methods provide insights that can enable healthcare providers to develop targeted preventive health management programs to reducehospital admissions and associated high costs. The baseline comorbidity network has the potential to be used as the basis to develop a chronic disease risk prediction model.

It also proposes a way to include questionnaires - widely used in epidemiology in the individual's reasoning mechanism in order to identify his/her attitude and personal choices. SimNCD is a formal agent-based model. It helps researchers and health practitioners study and simulate the complex dynamics of noncommunicable diseases. It models individuals that evolve within a social network, and behave while engaging in activities offered by their physical environment. The literature strongly supports the influence of the individual's behavioral choices on their health, particularly, the acquirement and maintainability of noncommunicable diseases. Therefore, we propose to extend SimNCD in order to acquire the agents with a reasoning process that allows them to choose the activities to practice. Thus, we model their attitude via preferences that are modeled based on the available literature and expressed with the linguistic 2-tuple method. Our solution also employs a multi-attribute decision-making method. We specify the proposed solution in the study of childhood obesity and use it to predict children's corpulence variations in different scenarios.

Aims: This study intended to explore the use and impact of educational technology in medical education in resource-constrained environments. Methods: A multiple case study was conducted in two Nepalese teaching hospitals. The data were analysed using activity theory as an analytical basis. Results: There was little evidence for formal e-learning, but the findings indicate that students and residents adopted mobile technologies, such as mobile phones and small laptops, as cultural tools for surprisingly rich 'informal' learning in a very short time. These tools allowed learners to enhance (a) situated learning, by immediately connecting virtual information sources to their situated experiences; (b) cross-contextual learning by documenting situated experiences in the form of images and videos and re-using the material for later reflection and discussion and (c) engagement with educational content in social network communities. Conclusion: By placing the students and residents at the centre of the new learning activities, this development has begun to affect the overall educational system. Leveraging these tools is closely linked to the development of broad media literacy, including awareness of ethical and privacy issues.

The social position of individuals in formal and informal social networks, and the relevance of formal roles in relation to EIDM are important factors identifying key EIDM players in public health organizations. We assessed the role of central actors in information sharing networks in promoting the adoption of EIDM by the staff of three public health units in Canada, over a two-year period during which an organization-wide intervention was implemented. Methods: A multi-faceted and tailored intervention to train select staff applying research evidence in practice was implemented in three public health units in Canada from 2011 to 2013. Staff (n = 572) were asked to identify those in the health unit whom they turned to get help using research in practice, whom they considered as experts in EIDM, and friends. We developed multi-level linear regression models to predict the change in EIDM behavior scores predicted by being connected to peers who were central in networks and were engaged in the intervention. Results: Only the group of highly engaged central actors who were connected to each other, and the staff who were not engaged in the intervention but were connected to highly engaged central actors significantly improved their EIDM behavior scores. Among the latter group, the staff who were also friends with their information sources showed a larger improvement in EIDM behavior. Conclusions: If engaged, central network actors use their formal and informal connections to promote EIDM. Central actors themselves are more likely to adopt EIDM if they communicate with each other. These social communications should be reinforced and supported through the implementation of training interventions as a means to promoting EIDM.

Patient Experiences with Screening and Assistance for Social Isolation in Primary Care Settings	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						social isolation; social risk; social determinants of health; health-related social needs		Background Social isolation is a known predictor of mortality that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in the USA. Although experts began to recognize it as a public health crisis prior to 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic has accelerated recognition of social isolation as a serious threat to health and well-being. Objective Examine patient experiences with screening and assistance for social isolation in primary care settings, and whether patient experiences with these activities are associated with the severity of reported social isolation. Design Cross-sectional survey conducted in 2018. Participants Adults (N = 251) were recruited from 3 primary care clinics in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. Main Measures A modified version of the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index (SNI), endorsed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; items to assess for prior experiences with screening and assistance for social isolation. Key Results In the sample population, 12.4% reported the highest levels of social isolation (SNI = 0/1), compared to 36.7%, 34.7%, and 16.3% (SNI = 2-4, respectively). Most patients had not been asked about social isolation in a healthcare setting (87.3%), despite reporting no discomfort with social isolation screening (93.9%). Neither discomfort with nor participation in prior screening for social isolation was associated with social isolation levels. Desire for assistance with social isolation (3.2%) was associated with a higher level of social isolation (AOR = 6.0, 95% CI, 1.3-28.8), as well as poor or fair health status (AOR = 9.1; 95% CI, 1.3-64.1). Conclusions In this study, few patients reported being screened previously for social isolation in a primary care setting, despite low levels of discomfort with screening. Providers should consider broadening social isolation screening and referral practices in healthcare settings, especially among sicker and more isolated patients who express higher levels of interest in assistance with social isolation.

J	Sun, XJ; Lucas, H; Meng, QY; Zhang, YG				Sun, Xiaojie; Lucas, Henry; Meng, Qingyue; Zhang, Yaoguang			Associations between living arrangements and health-related quality of life of urban elderly people: a study from China	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						China; Residence characteristics; Health-related quality of life; Aged; Interpersonal relations	MARITAL-STATUS; QUESTIONNAIRE; RELIABILITY; TRANSITIONS; MORTALITY; VALIDITY; EUROQOL; STATES; RISK; AGE	This study aimed to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for elderly men and women in three mutually exclusive living arrangements: living alone, living only with spouse, and non-empty-nesters. It also examined whether such living arrangements and other factors relating to social interaction have an independent influence on HRQOL after controlling for other variables. The data were drawn from China's 4th National Household Health Survey (NHHS) conducted in 2008. The final sample included 9,711 urban elderly people of 60 years and above. The EQ-5D inventory was used to measure health-related quality of life. The proportions of non-empty-nested men and women both changed following a 'U'-shaped curve with the increasing age. Controlling for other variables not including social interaction indicators, "living alone" was a significant predictor of reporting problems on Mobility, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression. After introducing social interaction indicators, urban older adults 'having close contact with neighbors every week' had lower odds of problems on all five EQ-5D indicators, those 'having close contact with friends and relatives' had lower odds of problems on Mobility, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression, and those 'taking part in social activities every week' had lower odds of problems on all dimensions but Anxiety/Depression. In addition, after introducing social interaction indicators, the odds of reported problems on the three dimensions increased obviously. This study suggests that the most vulnerable urban older adults are those who live entirely on their own. Frequent social interaction may buffer the negative effect of living alone on HRQOL of older adults. Policies that attempt to build harmonious neighborhoods, extend older adults' social network and encourage them to take part in social activities should be considered by the policy-makers in the future.

Transforming mental health services: a participatory mixed methods study to promote and evaluate the implementation of recovery-oriented services	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Recovery; Applied policy; Mixed methods; Social network analysis; Ethnography; Narrative-phenomenology; Participatory research; Integrated knowledge translation	OPINION LEADERS; COMMUNITY	Background: Since 2007, the Mental Health Commission of Canada has worked collaboratively across all provinces to publish a framework and strategy for recovery and well-being. This federal document is now mandated as policy for implementation between 2012 and 2017. The proposed strategies have been written into provincial health plans, hospital accreditation standards, and annual objectives of psychiatric departments and community organizations. The core premise is: to empower persons with mental illness and their families to become participants in designing their own care, while meeting the needs of a diverse Canadian population. However, recovery principles do not come with an implementation guide to fit the variability of different local contexts. How can policy recommendations and accreditation standards be effectively tailored to support a diversity of stakeholder values? To our knowledge, there is little evidence indicating the most effective manner to accelerate the uptake of recovery-oriented services among providers in a given/particular mental health treatment setting. Methods/Design: This three-year Canadian Institute of Health Research Partnership in Health System Improvement and The Rx&D Health Research Foundation (HRF) Fostering Canadian Innovation in Research study (2013 to 2017) proposed participatory approaches to implementing recovery principles in a Department of Psychiatry serving a highly diverse Canadian and immigrant population. This project will be conducted in overlapping and recursive phases: I) Conduct formative research to (a) measure the current knowledge and attitudes toward recovery and recovery-oriented practices among service providers, while concurrently (b) exploring the experiential knowledge of recovery service-users and family members; II) Collaborate with service-users and the network-identified opinion leaders among providers to tailor Recovery-in-Action Initiatives to fit the needs and resources of a Department of Psychiatry; and III) Conduct a systematic theory-based evaluation of changes in attitudes and practices within the service-user/service-provider partnership group relative to the overall provider network of the department and identify the barriers and supports within the local context. Discussion: Our anticipated outcome is a participatory toolkit to tailor recovery-oriented services, which will be disseminated to the Mental Health Commission of Canada and Accreditation Canada at the federal level, agencies at the provincial levels, and local knowledge end-users.

Enhancing evidence-based diabetes and chronic disease control among local health departments: a multi-phase dissemination study with a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial component	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Dissemination research; Evidence-based public health; Public health workforce; Diabetes control; Chronic disease prevention	EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; DECISION-MAKING; KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT; ORGANIZATIONAL-FACTORS; PREVENTIVE-SERVICES; OBESITY PREVENTION; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY	Background: The rates of diabetes and prediabetes in the USA are growing, significantly impacting the quality and length of life of those diagnosed and financially burdening society. Premature death and disability can be prevented through implementation of evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs). Local health departments (LHDs) are uniquely positioned to implement diabetes control EBPPs because of their knowledge of, and focus on, community-level needs, contexts, and resources. There is a significant gap, however, between known diabetes control EBPPs and actual diabetes control activities conducted by LHDs. The purpose of this study is to determine how best to support the use of evidence-based public health for diabetes (and related chronic diseases) control among local-level public health practitioners. Methods/design: This paper describes the methods for a two-phase study with a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial that will evaluate dissemination strategies to increase the uptake of public health knowledge and EBPPs for diabetes control among LHDs. Phase 1 includes development of measures to assess practitioner views on and organizational supports for evidence-based public health, data collection using a national online survey of LHD chronic disease practitioners, and a needs assessment of factors influencing the uptake of diabetes control EBPPs among LHDs within one state in the USA. Phase 2 involves conducting a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to assess effectiveness of dissemination strategies with local-level practitioners at LHDs to enhance capacity and organizational support for evidence-based diabetes prevention and control. Twelve LHDs will be selected and randomly assigned to one of the three groups that cross over from usual practice to receive the intervention (dissemination) strategies at 8-month intervals; the intervention duration for groups ranges from 8 to 24 months. Intervention (dissemination) strategies may include multi-day in-person workshops, electronic information exchange methods, technical assistance through a knowledge broker, and organizational changes to support evidence-based public health approaches. Evaluation methods comprise surveys at baseline and the three crossover time points, abstraction of local-level diabetes and chronic disease control program plans and progress reports, and social network analysis to understand the relationships and contextual issues that influence EBPP adoption.

We tested whether engagement of staff in the intervention and their EIDM behavior were associated with being chosen as information source and how the trend of inter-divisional communications and the dominance of experts evolved over time. Methods: Local managers at each health unit selected a group of staff to get engage in Knowledge Broker-led workshops and development of evidence summaries to address local public health problems. The staff were invited to answer three online surveys (at baseline and two annual follow-ups) including name generator questions eliciting the list of the staff they would turn to for help integrating research evidence into practice. We used stochastic actor-oriented modeling to study the evolution of networks. We tested the effect of engagement in the intervention, EIDM behavior scores, organizational divisions, and structural dynamics of social networks on the tendency of staff to select information sources, and the change in its trend between year 1 and year 2 of follow-up. Results: In all the three health units, and especially in the two units with higher levels of engagement in the intervention, the network evolved towards a more centralized structure, with an increasing significance of already central staff. The staff showed greater tendencies to seek information from peers with higher EIDM behavior scores. In the public health unit that had highest engagement and stronger leadership support, the engaged staff became more central. In all public health units, the engaged staff showed an increasing tendency towards forming clusters. The staff in the three public health units showed a tendency towards limiting their connections within their divisions. Conclusions: The longitudinal analysis provided us with a means to study the microstructural changes in public health units, clues to the sustainability of the implementation. The hierarchical transformation of networks towards experts and formation of clusters among staff who were engaged in the intervention show how implementing organizational interventions to promote EIDM may affect the knowledge flow and distribution in health care communities, which may lead to unanticipated consequences.

The imperative has therefore shifted from amassing evidence about efficacy to scale-up to maximise population-level health gains. Electronic implementation monitoring, or 'e-monitoring', systems have been designed to assist and track the delivery of preventive policies and programs. However, there is little evidence on whether emonitoring systems improve the dissemination, adoption, and ongoing delivery of evidence-based preventive programs. Also, given considerable difficulties with e-monitoring systems in the clinical sector, scholars have called for a more sophisticated re-examination of e-monitoring's role in enhancing implementation. Methods: In the state of New South Wales ( NSW), Australia, the Population Health Information Management System (PHIMS) was created to support the dissemination of obesity prevention programs to 6000 childcare centres and elementary schools across all 15 local health districts. We have established a three-way university-policymakerpractice research partnership to investigate the impact of PHIMS on practice, how PHIMS is used, and how achievement of key performance indicators of program adoption may be associated with local contextual factors. Our methods encompass ethnographic observation, key informant interviews and participatory workshops for data interpretation at a state and local level. We use an on-line social network analysis of the collaborative relationships across local health district health promotion teams to explore the relationship between PHIMS use and the organisational structure of practice. Discussion: Insights will be sensitised by institutional theory, practice theory and complex adaptive system thinking, among other theories which make sense of socio-technical action. Our working hypothesis is that the science of getting evidence-based programs into practice rests on an in-depth understanding of the role they play in the on-going system of local relationships and multiple accountabilities. Data will be synthesised to produce a typology to characterise local context, PHIMS use and key performance indicator achievement (of program implementation) across the 15 local health districts. Results could be used to continuously align e-monitoring technologies within quality improvement processes to ensure that such technologies enhance practice and innovation. A partnership approach to knowledge production increases the likelihood that findings will be put into practice.

Current work to quantify provider coordination has primarily relied on identifying shared patients, but neglects to understand communication patterns. We applied social network analysis to electronic health record (EHR) secure messaging data to compare networks of providers who share patients and networks of providers who communicate about patients. We studied 2175 stage I - III breast cancer patients who received outpatient treatment from 1758 providers at a large academic medical center in the southeastern United States. Patients in our cohort were involved in 94324 appointments and were the subject of 307144 message threads. We found that 9.9% of provider-provider pairs that shared patients were mutually involved in electronic communication about their patients. EHR data sources can be used to evaluate provider communication across a clinical enterprise, which can help identify opportunities to improve collaboration and reduce provider burnout.

Patients suffer from several chronic issues, comorbidities and high-mortality rates. Despite its prevalence, the disease remains largely ignored. A literature review was conducted and a questionnaire was sent to patients in order to understand the potential of e-health tools to support people with SCD. Additionally, focus groups have been conducted to detail respondents' answers. The results showed that patients felt isolated and misunderstood. They also highlighted patients' wishes for a social network able to make them feel less scattered. Using participatory-design techniques, we designed a prototype of user-centric interface for an online self-supportive SCD patient community. The mock-ups include chatrooms, forums and videoconferences capabilities. They illustrate how SCD patients' social networking and caregivers-patient relationship needs could be met. Future work will focus on the implementation and evaluation of the system.

J	de Carvalho, MA; Tio, RA; Steinert, Y				de Carvalho-Filho, Marco Antonio; Tio, Rene A.; Steinert, Yvonne			Twelve tips for implementing a community of practice for faculty development	MEDICAL TEACHER			English	Article							PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; SOCIAL NETWORK; FRAMEWORK; TEACHERS; COMPETENCES; IDENTITY; TRUST	Teaching and learning practices often fail to incorporate new concepts in the ever-evolving field of medical education. Although medical education research provides new insights into curricular development, learners' engagement, assessment methods, professional development, interprofessional education, and so forth, faculty members often struggle to modernize their teaching practices. Communities of practice (CoP) for faculty development offer an effective and sustainable approach for knowledge management and implementation of best practices. A successful CoP creates and shares knowledge in the context of a specific practice toward the development of expertise. CoPs' collaborative nature, based on the co-creation of practical solutions to daily problems, aligns well with the goals of applying best practices in health professions education and training new faculty members. In our article, we share 12 tips for implementing a community of practice for faculty development. The tips were based on a comprehensive literature review and the authors' experiences.

The low-income population is less likely to be receptive to nutritional recommendations, but providing cooking advice could be more effective. In this domain, taking advantage of digital devices can be a bonus with its own challenges. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and deploy NutCracker, a social network-based cooking app for low-income population, including cooking tips and nutritional advices, aiming at creating small online communities. We further determined the usefulness, perceptions, barriers, and motivators to use NutCracker. Methods: The smartphone app, designed jointly with beneficiaries of the social emergency services, was implemented in a disadvantaged neighborhood of Magny, (Paris region, France). Once the app became available, 28 subjects, living in the neighborhood, tested the app for a 6-month period. Logs to the app and usages were collected by the software. In total, 12 in-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted among the users and the social workers to analyze their uses and perceptions of the app relative to their interest in cooking, cooking skills, socioeconomic constraints, and social integration. These interviews were compared with 21 supplementary interviews conducted among low-income individuals in the general population. Results: NutCracker was developed as a social network-based app, and it includes cooking tips, nutritional advice, and Web-based quizzes. We identified barriers to uses (especially technical barriers, lack of knowledge in the field of new technologies and written comprehension, and search for real contacts) and motivators (in particular, good social integration, previous use of social networks, and help of children as intermediaries). Cooking skills were both a barrier and a lever. Conclusions: Targeting the low-income groups through a cooking app to promote healthier behaviors offers many advantages but has not been fully explored. However, the barriers in low-income milieu remain high, especially among the less socially integrated strata. Lessons from this intervention allow us to identify barriers and possible levers to improve nutrition promotion and awareness in deprived areas, especially in the time of social crisis.

Forging a link between mentoring and collaboration: a new training model for implementation science	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Mentoring; Scientific collaboration; Training; Network analysis; Implementation science; Team science; Implementation Research Institute	NETWORK ANALYSIS; HEALTH RESEARCH; SOCIAL NETWORK; DISSEMINATION; INSTITUTE; PROGRAMS; SUPPORT	Background: Training investigators for the rapidly developing field of implementation science requires both mentoring and scientific collaboration. Using social network descriptive analyses, visualization, and modeling, this paper presents results of an evaluation of the mentoring and collaborations fostered over time through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) supported by Implementation Research Institute (IRI). Methods: Data were comprised of IRI participant self-reported collaborations and mentoring relationships, measured in three annual surveys from 2012 to 2014. Network descriptive statistics, visualizations, and network statistical modeling were conducted to examine patterns of mentoring and collaboration among IRI participants and to model the relationship between mentoring and subsequent collaboration. Results: Findings suggest that IRI is successful in forming mentoring relationships among its participants, and that these mentoring relationships are related to future scientific collaborations. Exponential random graph network models demonstrated that mentoring received in 2012 was positively and significantly related to the likelihood of having a scientific collaboration 2 years later in 2014 (p = 0.001). More specifically, mentoring was significantly related to future collaborations focusing on new research (p = 0.009), grant submissions (p = 0.003), and publications (p = 0.017). Predictions based on the network model suggest that for every additional mentoring relationships established in 2012, the likelihood of a scientific collaboration 2 years later is increased by almost 7 %. Conclusions: These results support the importance of mentoring in implementation science specifically and team science more generally. Mentoring relationships were established quickly and early by the IRI core faculty. IRI fellows reported increasing scientific collaboration of all types over time, including starting new research, submitting new grants, presenting research results, and publishing peer-reviewed papers. Statistical network models demonstrated that mentoring was strongly and significantly related to subsequent scientific collaboration, which supported a core design principle of the IRI. Future work should establish the link between mentoring and scientific productivity. These results may be of interest to team science, as they suggest the importance of mentoring for future team collaborations, as well as illustrate the utility of network analysis for studying team characteristics and activities.

Advice-seeking during implementation: a network study of clinicians participating in a learning collaborative	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Learning collaborative; Advice-seeking; Social network analysis; Mental health services	TRANSACTIVE MEMORY-SYSTEMS; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT COLLABORATIVES; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; EXPERTISE; ORGANIZATIONS; EVOLUTION; DISSEMINATION; ACCESSIBILITY; DIMENSIONS	Background: Successful implementation depends on the transfer of knowledge and expertise among clinicians, which can occur when professionals seek advice from one another. This study examines advice-seeking patterns among mental health clinicians participating in learning collaboratives (a multi-component implementation and quality improvement strategy) to implement trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). We apply transactive memory system theory, which explains how professionals access and retrieve knowledge, to examine factors associated with the evolution of advice-seeking relationships during implementation. Our aim is to unpack learning collaboratives' mechanisms by investigating how and why advice-seeking networks change, which may help us understand how implementation strategies can best target networks. Methods: Using social network analysis and a pretest-post-test design, we examined patterns in general and treatment-specific advice-seeking among 146 participants (including five clinical experts) from 27 agencies participating in a regional scale-up of TF-CBT. Surveys were administered in-person at the first and last of three inperson learning sessions (10 months apart) that comprise a core component of learning collaboratives. Participants nominated up to five individuals from whom they seek general and treatment-specific advice. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) tested the likelihood of maintaining or forming advice-seeking relationships based on indicators of expertise quality, accessibility, need, and prior advice-seeking relationships. Results: Participants formed or maintained advice-seeking relationships with those who possess perceived expertise (e.g., learning collaborative faculty experts, supervisors, and those with greater field experience than themselves). Participants also tended to seek advice from those within the same organization and with similar disciplinary training, highlighting the importance of expertise accessibility. Prior relationships and network structural features were associated with advice-seeking, indicating that participants built on existing social ties. Advice-seeking did not vary based on participants' role or experience. Conclusions: Given the importance of accessible clinical expertise and ongoing supervision for delivering treatment with fidelity, learning collaboratives may support implementation by promoting clinicians' awareness of and access to others' expertise, especially those with substantial expertise to share (e.g., faculty experts and supervisors). Future controlled studies are needed to verify the effectiveness of learning collaboratives for building networks that connect clinicians and experts and for improving implementation.

Loss and bereavement in late life (60+): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial regarding an internet-based self-help intervention	INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH			English	Article						Grief; Loss; Late-life; RCT; eHealth	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY; PROLONGED GRIEF DISORDER; OLDER-ADULTS; COMPLICATED GRIEF; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; SOCIAL NETWORK; DEPRESSION; HEALTH; SYMPTOMS; VERSION	Background: The death of a close person is a highly stressful, yet common life event in later life. While most individuals seem to cope well with bereavement, a substantial proportion of older individuals suffer from prolonged grief symptoms. E-mental health interventions have been shown to be efficient for a variety of psychological illnesses. Yet, there is a large research gap of studies with a special focus on older adults. This study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial for an internet-based self-help intervention addressing bereavement and loss in adults aged 60 years and over. The self-management intervention is based on techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy and consists of 8 modules. The objective of the AgE-health study is to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of this intervention in comparison to a bibliotherapy control group. Methods: The AgE-health study aims at implementing a randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants aged 60+ years will be randomly allocated to an intervention group (access to the intervention) or to an active control group (access to bibliotherapy). Primary outcome is the reduction in grief symptoms (13-item Prolonged Grief Inventory); secondary outcomes are depression, social activity and network, quality of life, self-efficacy, satisfaction with the intervention/bibliotherapy, loneliness, acceptability, up-take and adherence. Assessments will take place before the intervention (baseline) as well as 4 months (follow-up 1) after the intervention. Discussion: This study addresses an under-recognized and understudied mental health burden in later life and may add valuable insight into our knowledge about the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for loss and bereavement in late life. To our knowledge, the AgE-health study will be the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an internet-based intervention targeting prolonged grief in adults aged 60 years and over.

The government of Uganda is currently debating policy for the national health insurance programme, targeting the integration of existing CBHI schemes into a larger national risk pool. However, while enrolment has been largely studied in other countries, it remains a generally under-covered issue from a Ugandan perspective. Using a large CBI II scheme, this study, therefore, aims at shedding more light on the determinants of households' decisions to enrol and renew membership in these schemes. Methods: We collected household data from 464 households in 14 villages served by a large CBI II scheme in southwestern Uganda. We then estimated logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regressions to understand the determinants of enrolment and renewing membership in CBHI, respectively. Results: Results revealed that household's socioeconomic status, husband's employment in rural casual work (odds ratio [OR]: 2.581, CI: 1.104-6.032) and knowledge of health insurance premiums (OR: 17.072, CI: 7.027-41.477) were significant predictors of enrolment. Social capital and connectivity, assessed by the number of voluntary groups a household belonged to, was also positively associated with CBHI participation (OR 5.664, CI: 2.927-10.963). More positive perceptions on insurance (OR 2.991, CI: 1.273-7.029), access to information were also associated with enrolment and renewing among others. Burial group size and number of burial groups in a village, were all significantly associated with increased the likelihood of renewing CBHI. Conclusion: While socioeconomic factors remain important predictors of participation in insurance, mechanisms to promote inclusion should be devised. Improving the participation of communities can enhance trust in insurance and eventual coverage. Moreover, for households already insured, access to correct information and strengthening their social network information pathways enhances their chances of renewing.

This study assessed the relationship between neighborhood and individual social networks and child oral health-related quality of life (COHRQoL). Methods This study followed a cross-sectional design using a multistage sample of 478 children aged 1-5 years old. Caregivers completed the Brazilian version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) and answered questions related to socioeconomic status and social network. The dental examination provided information on the prevalence of dental caries, dental trauma, and occlusion. Contextual social determinants included the presence of cultural community centers and of workers' association in the neighborhood. Data analysis considered the total ECOHIS scores as the outcome and neighborhood/individual social networks as the independent variables. A multilevel Poisson regression model was used to investigate the association among individual and contextual characteristics and COHRQoL. Results Total ECOHIS scores ranged from 0 to 41 (possible range 0-52). The mean ECOHIS score was low (mean = 1.8, SD = 3.9), and the functional domain presented the highest mean impact on COHRQoL (mean = 0.5, SD = 1.4). Following adjusted analysis, low household income, visiting a neighbor less than once a month, the presence of anterior open bite, dental trauma, and dental caries were identified as individual determinants of negative impact on a child's quality of life. These variables remained associated with the outcome even after adding the contextual-level variables in the model. At the contextual level, the presence of community cultural centers was associated with overall mean ECOHIS score; higher impacts on COHRQoL were observed in those living in neighborhoods without cultural community centers. Conclusion There is a significant association between individual and contextual social determinants and COHRQoL; unfavorable social conditions and poor socioeconomic status have a negative impact on caregiver reports of children's oral health-related quality of life.

Enemies and friends in high-tech places: the development and validation of the Online Social Experiences Measure	DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article						Online social networks; technology-mediated communication; social media; social network sites; social support; ambulatory blood pressure	AMBULATORY BLOOD-PRESSURE; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; RELATIONSHIP QUALITY; NETWORK SITES; CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION; SUPPORT; HEALTH; RISK; METAANALYSIS; AMBIVALENCE	Background Interpersonal positivity and negativity are separable dimensions both recognized as having important effects on health. Though online social interactions and research examining them are increasingly common, no validated instrument has heretofore been developed to examine social support and social negativity specifically in online contexts. The present studies describe the development and validation of the Online Social Experiences Measure (OSEM) to allow for assessment of online social positivity and negativity simultaneously. Methods and results In Study I, responses to a potential item pool were collected from participants (N = 557), who were then subdivided into two groups for the purposes of cross-validation via exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Results suggested the emergence of two factors: online social support (OSEM+ subscale) and online social negativity (OSEM- subscale). Across Studies I and II (N = 139), the OSEM showed good convergent and discriminant validity, and both subscales had high internal consistency. Study II included an ambulatory cardiovascular assessment and found the OSEM- subscale to be predictive of elevated diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. The OSEM+ subscale was predictive of more favorable cardiovascular readings for some types of participants (e.g. those with a greater number of online-only social ties). Conclusions Overall, results suggest online social positivity and negativity may have implications for physical health, and that the OSEM may be a useful tool in understanding online social processes.

Prior research has shown that patient-consumers do not frequently use information on websites reporting physician quality to guide their choice of physicians. Our aim is to understand the contextual and personal characteristics that influence patient-consumers' decisions to trust or ignore information sources about healthcare quality. We use data fromFinding Quality Doctors: How Americans Evaluate Provider Quality in the US, 2014, to examine factors that explain trust in sources reporting healthcare quality provided by physicians. Using factor analysis, 3 overarching information sources were identified: (1) employers and healthcare providers; (2) user advocacy sources; and (3) insurance companies and government. We use multiple regression analysis to understand the factors that impact trust in these 3 information sources. Our study found that contrary to previous findings, health status was not a significant factor that affects trust in sources reporting care quality data. Also, age was the only factor that significantly correlated with trusting information from all 3 sources. Specifically, younger adults trusted information from all sources compared to older adults. Furthermore, political affiliation, employment status, income, and area of residence correlated with trusting care quality information from either companies and government agencies or family and social network sources. Results suggest that individual and contextual characteristics are significant factors in trusting information sources regardless of health status and these should be taken into consideration by those promoting public reporting of healthcare quality information.

This demand for information has given rise to many online weight management communities, where users support one another throughout their weight loss process. Whether and how user engagement in online communities relates to weight change is not totally understood. Objective: We investigated the activity behavior and analyze the semantic content of the messages of active users in LoseIt (r/loseit), a weight management community of the online social network Reddit. We then explored whether these features are associated with weight loss in this online social network. Methods: A data collection tool was used to collect English posts, comments, and other public metadata of active users (ie, users with at least one post or comment) on LoseIt from August 2010 to November 2014. Analyses of frequency and intensity of user interaction in the community were performed together with a semantic analysis of the messages, done by a latent Dirichlet allocation method. The association between weight loss and online user activity patterns, the semantics of the messages, and real-world variables was found by a linear regression model using 30-day weight change as the dependent variable. Results: We collected posts and comments of 107,886 unique users. Among these, 101,003 (93.62%) wrote at least one comment and 38,981 (36.13%) wrote at least one post. Median percentage of days online was 3.81 (IQR 9.51). The 10 most-discussed semantic topics on posts were related to healthy food, clothing, calorie counting, workouts, looks, habits, support, and unhealthy food. In the subset of 754 users who had gender, age, and 30-day weight change data available, women were predominant and 92.9% (701/754) lost weight. Female gender, body mass index (BMI) at baseline, high levels of online activity, the number of upvotes received per post, and topics discussed within the community were independently associated with weight change. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that among active users of a weight management community, self-declaration of higher BMI levels (which may represent greater dissatisfaction with excess weight), high online activity, and engagement in discussions that might provide social support are associated with greater weight loss. These findings have the potential to aid health professionals to assist patients in online interventions by focusing efforts on increasing engagement and/or starting discussions on topics of higher impact on weight change.

The Personal Health Network Mobile App for Chemotherapy Care Coordination: Qualitative Evaluation of a Randomized Clinical Trial	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						care coordination; continuity of patient care; oncology; chemotherapy; patient-centered care; mobile health; technology adoption	PATIENT-CENTERED CARE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CANCER-TREATMENT; COMMUNICATION; SURVIVORS; MEDICARE; IMPROVE; SEEKING; SYSTEM; NEEDS	Background: Cancer care coordination addresses the fragmented and inefficient care of individuals with complex care needs. The complexity of care coordination can be aided by innovative technology. Few examples of information technology-enabled care coordination exist beyond the conventional telephone follow-up. For this study, we implemented a custom-designed app, the Personal Health Network (PHN)-a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant social network built around a patient to enable patient-centered health and health care activities in collaboration with clinicians, care team members, caregivers, and others designated by the patient. The app facilitates a care coordination intervention for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Objective: This study aimed to understand patient experiences with PHN technology and assess their perspectives on the usability and usefulness of PHNs with care coordination during chemotherapy. Methods: A two-arm randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the PHN and care coordination with care coordination alone over a 6-month period beginning with the initiation of chemotherapy. A semistructured interview guide was constructed based on a theoretical framework of technology acceptance addressing usefulness, usability, and the context of use of the technology within the participant's life and health care setting. All participants in the intervention arm were interviewed on completion of the study. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim A summative thematic analysis was completed for the transcribed interviews. Features of the app were also evaluated. Results: A total of 27 interviews were completed. The resulting themes included the care coordinator as a partner in care, learning while sick, comparison of other technology to make sense of the PHN, communication, learning, usability, and usefulness. Users expressed that the nurse care coordinators were beneficial to them because they helped them stay connected to the care team and answered their questions. They shared that the mobile app gave them access to the health information they were seeking. Users expressed that the mobile app would be more useful if it was fully integrated with the electronic health record. Conclusions: The findings highlight the value of care coordination from the perspectives of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and the important role of technology, such as the PHN, in enhancing this process by facilitating better communication and access to information regarding their illness.

While many published articles suggest the potential for social media is positive, there is a lack of robust examination into mediating mechanisms that might help explain social media's therapeutic value. This study presents findings from a global online survey of people with chronic pain (PWCP) to better understand how they use social media as part of self-management. Objective: Our aim is to improve understanding of the various health outcomes reported by PWCP by paying close attention to therapeutic affordances of social media. We wish to examine if demographics of participants underpin health outcomes and whether the concept of therapeutic affordances explains links between social media use and PROs. The goal is for this to help tailor future recommendations for use of social media to meet individuals' health needs and improve clinical practice of social media use. Methods: A total of 231 PWCP took part in a global online survey investigating PROs from social media use. Recruited through various chronic disease entities and social networks, participants provided information on demographics, health/pain status, social media use, therapeutic affordances, and PROs from use. Quantitative analysis was performed on the data using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, and cluster analysis. Results: The total dataset represented 218 completed surveys. The majority of participants were university educated (67.0%, 146/218) and female (83.9%, 183/218). More than half (58.7%, 128/218) were married/partnered and not working for pay (75.9%, 88/116 of these due to ill health). Fibromyalgia (46.6%, 55/118) and arthritis (27.1%, 32/118) were the most commonly reported conditions causing pain. Participants showed a clear affinity for social network site use (90.0%, 189/210), followed by discussion forums and blogs. PROs were consistent, suggesting that social media positively impact psychological, social, and cognitive health. Analysis also highlighted two strong correlations linking platform used and health outcomes (particularly psychological, social, and cognitive) to (1) the narrative affordance of social media and (2) frequency of use of the platforms. Conclusions: Results did not uncover definitive demographics or characteristics of PWCP for which health outcomes are impacted. However, findings corroborate literature within this domain suggesting that there is a typical profile of people who use social media for health and that social media are more suited to particular health outcomes. Exploration of the relationship between social media's therapeutic affordances and health outcomes, in particular the narration affordance, warrants further attention by patients and clinicians.

Implications for Health Communication and Behavioral Interventions	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						youth; adolescent; Vietnam; mHealth; mobile phone; app	ADOLESCENTS; PHONE; MANAGEMENT; ALCOHOL; SUPPORT; ONLINE	Background: Mobile phone use in Vietnam has become increasingly popular in recent years, with youth (people aged 15-24 years) being one of the groups with the heaviest use. Health-related apps on mobile phones (mobile health [mHealth] apps) appear to be a feasible approach for disease and health management, especially for self-management. However, there has been a scarcity of research on mobile phone usage for health care among youth and adolescents. Objective: This study aims to identify the patterns of usage of mobile phone apps and the preferences for functionalities of mobile phone-based health-related apps among Vietnamese youth. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted in Vietnam in August to October 2015. Web-based respondent-driven sampling technique was adopted to recruit participants. The online questionnaire was developed and distributed using Google Forms. Chi square and Mann-Whitney tests were used to investigate the difference in attitude and preference for mobile phone apps between the two genders. Results: Among 356 youths (age from 15 to 25 years) sampled, low prevalence was found of using mHealth apps such as beauty counseling (6.5%, 23/356), nutrition counseling (7.9%, 28/356), disease prevention (9.8%, 35/356), and disease treatment (7.6%, 27/356). The majority of users found the app(s) they used to be useful (72.7%, 48/356) and reported satisfaction with these apps (61.9%, 39/356). No significant differences were found between the genders in their perception of the usefulness of apps and their satisfaction with mobile health apps. Most of the participants (68.2%, 238/356) preferred apps which are conceptualized and designed to run on a mobile phone compared to Web-based apps, and 50% (176/356) preferred visual materials. Approximately 53.9% (188/356) reported that it was integral for the mobile phone apps to have a sharing/social network functionality. Participants with a higher perceived stress score and EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) index were significantly less likely to use mHealth apps. Conclusions: This study found a low proportion using mHealth-related mobile phone apps, but a high level of receptiveness and satisfaction among Vietnamese youth. Acceptance level and preferences toward mHealth apps as well as specifically preferred functionalities discovered in this study are essential not only in conceptualizing and developing appropriate mobile phone interventions targeting youth and adolescents, but also in the application of technically advanced solutions in disease prevention and health management.

There are multiple studies on internet access and usage, quality of information, and information needs. However, few studies explored negative outcomes of OCHI in detail or from different perspectives, and none examined how these negative outcomes could be reduced. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe negative outcomes associated with OCHI use in primary care and identify potential preventive strategies from consumers', health practitioners', and health librarians' perspectives. Methods: This included a two-stage interpretive qualitative study. In the first stage, we recruited through a social media survey, a purposeful sample of 19 OCHI users who had experienced negative outcomes associated with OCHI. We conducted semistructured interviews and performed a deductive-inductive thematic analysis. The results also informed the creation of vignettes that were used in the next stage. In the second stage, we interviewed a convenient sample of 10 key informants: 7 health practitioners (3 family physicians, 2 nurses, and 2 pharmacists) and 3 health librarians. With the support of the vignettes, we asked participants to elaborate on (1) their experience with patients who have used OCHI and experienced negative outcomes and (2) what strategies they suggest to reduce these outcomes. We performed a deductive-inductive thematic analysis. Results: We found that negative outcomes of OCHI may occur at three levels: internal (such as increased worrying), interpersonal (such as a tension in the patient-clinician relationship), and service-related (such as postponing a clinical encounter). Participants also proposed three types of strategies to reduce the occurrence of these negative outcomes, namely, providing consumers with reliable OCHI, educating consumers on how to assess OCHI websites, and helping consumers present and discuss the OCHI they find with a health professional in their social network or a librarian for instance. Conclusions: We examined negative outcomes associated with using OCHI from five complementary perspectives (consumers, family physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and health librarians). We identified a construct of OCHI use-related tension that included and framed all negative outcomes. This construct has three dimensions (three interdependent levels): internal, interpersonal, and service-related tensions. Future research can focus on the implementation and effectiveness of the proposed strategies, which might contribute to reducing these tensions.

Cancer patients with minor children are increasing; however, they do not receive sufficient support. Objective. This study aimed to investigate the association between loneliness and the frequency of using online peer support groups among cancer patients with minor children. Methods. A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted from April to May 2019. Cancer patients with minor children were recruited from an online peer support group called "Cancer Parents." Individuals diagnosed with cancer and whose youngest children were younger than 18 years were enrolled. Materials included: the UCLA Loneliness Scale version 3 (UCLA-LS), K6 scale, abbreviated Lubben Social Network Scale, and the sociodemographic/clinical characteristics questionnaire. Multivariate logistics regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with the high loneliness group (defined as those above the median score on the UCLA-LS). Results. A total of 334 patients participated (79.9% female; mean age 43.1 years, standard deviation 5.8). The most common primary cancer type was breast (34.1%). The median score of the UCLA-LS was 45 (interquartile range 37-53). The multivariate logistics regression analysis revealed that the high loneliness group was significantly associated with the frequent use of online peer support group less than once a week (odds ratio [OR] = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.26-0.85; P = 0.012), with a smaller social network (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.73-0.83; P < 0.001), and higher psychological distress (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.09-1.23; P < 0.001). Conclusions. Frequent use of online peer support groups was associated with less loneliness among cancer patients with minor children. (C) 2020 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

The personal rationales for participation in socially directed support have not been addressed in the literature. To determine how people with COPD identify, engage and participate in socially supportive self-care practices, we conducted a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted between June 2010 and June 2021. Of 3536 articles, 8 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Using a meta-ethnography approach to the qualitative synthesis, new concepts were derived from the data to identify aligning themes and develop a conceptual model. Findings Interpretations from the papers yielded concepts of (1) accountability and personal responsibility in self-care, (2) valued positive relationships with clinicians, (3) understanding of illness through shared and personal experiences and (4) acknowledging social networks in fostering self-care engagement in people with COPD. The independence-experience (Index) model of synthesized (third order) interpretations highlighted the processes of social networks and self-care practices: (a) fear or avoidance of dependency, (b) learning from experiences of adaptive self-care behaviours and (c) including valued practices in self-care. Self-care strategies are formed through illness experiences and relatable social encounters. Conclusion The model derived from the third-order interpretations is a framework to describe socially supported self-care and can be used to direct future self-care strategies and target interventions for people with COPD. Patient or Public Contribution The findings and model were presented to the long-term conditions patient and public involvement group. The manuscript is coauthored by a public representative.

Despite their utility, data from both recent academic and market research have indicated high attrition rates of WAT users. Concurrently, evidence shows that social support (SS), delivered/obtained via social network services or sites (SNS), could increase adherence and engagement of PA intervention programs. To date, relatively few studies have looked at how WATs and SS may interact and affect PAs. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore how these two Internet and mobile technologies, WATs and SNS, could work together to foster sustainable PA behavior changes and habits among middle-aged adults (40-60 years old) in Taiwan. Methods: We used purposive sampling of Executive MBA Students from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology to participate in our qualitative research. In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with a total of 15 participants, including 9 WAT users and 6 nonusers. Analysis of the collected materials was done inductively using the thematic approach with no preset categories. Two authors from different professional backgrounds independently annotated and coded the transcripts, and then discussed and debated until consensus was reached on the final themes. Results: The thematic analysis revealed six themes: (1) WATs provided more awareness than motivation in PA with goal-setting and progress monitoring, (2) SS, delivered/obtained via SNS, increased users' adherence and engagement with WATs and vice versa, (3) a broad spectrum of configurations would be needed to deliver WATs with appropriately integrated SS functions, (4) WAT design, style, and appearance mattered even more than those of smartphones, as they are body-worn devices, (5) the user interfaces of WATs left a great deal to be desired, and (6) privacy concerns must be addressed before more mainstream consumers would consider adopting WATs. Conclusions: Participants perceived WATs as an awareness tool to understand one's PA level. It is evident from our study that SS, derived from SNS and other pertinent vehicles such as the LINE social messaging application (similar to WhatsApp and WeChat), will increase the engagement and adherence of WAT usage. Combining WATs and SNS enables cost-effective, scalable PA intervention programs with end-to-end services and data analytics capabilities, to elevate WATs from one-size-fits-all consumer electronics to personalized PA assistants.

Introduction: The empirical findings have been taken from a clinical project in southern Norway concerning multi-agency network meetings with persons between 14 and 25 years of age. The project explores how these meetings are perceived by professionals working in various sectors. Methodology: Data was collected through three interviews conducted with two focus groups, the first comprising health care professionals and the second professionals from the social and educational sectors. Content analysis was used to create categories through condensation and interpretation. The two main categories that emerged were 'professional role' and 'teamwork'. These were analysed and compared according to the two first meeting in the two focus groups. Results and discussion: The results indicate different levels of motivation and understanding regarding role transformation processes. The realization of transdisciplinary collaboration is dependent upon the professionals' mutual reliance. The professionals' participation is affected by stereotypes and differences in their sense of belonging to a certain network, and thus their identity transformation seems to be strongly affected. To encourage the use of integrated solutions in mental health care, the professionals' preference for teamwork, the importance of familiarity with each other and knowledge of cultural barriers should be addressed.

Scope, Influence, and Interdisciplinary Collaboration: The Publication Portfolio of the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program From 2006 Through 2017	EVALUATION & THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS			English	Article						translation; CTSA; bibliometrics; publications; research areas	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION; HEALTH	The Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program sponsors an array of innovative, collaborative research. This study uses complementary bibliometric approaches to assess thescope,influence, andinterdisciplinarycollaboration of publications supported by single CTSA hubs and those supported by multiple hubs. Authors identified articles acknowledging CTSA support and assessed the disciplinary scope of research areas represented in that publication portfolio, their citation influence, interdisciplinary overlap among research categories, and characteristics of publications supported by multihub collaborations. Since 2006, CTSA hubs supported 69,436 articles published in 4,927 journals and 189 research areas. The portfolio is well distributed across diverse research areas with above-average citation influence. Most supported publications involvedclinical/health sciences, for example, neurology and pediatrics;life sciences, for example, neuroscience and immunology; or a combination of the two. Publications supported by multihub collaborations had distinct content emphasis, stronger citation influence, and greater interdisciplinary overlap. This study characterizes the CTSA consortium's contributions to clinical and translational science, identifies content areas of strength, and provides evidence for the success of multihub collaborations. These methods lay the foundation for future investigation of the best policies and priorities for fostering translational science and allow hubs to understand their progress benchmarked against the larger consortium.

Facebook as a Novel Tool for Continuous Professional Education on Dementia: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						dementia; Facebook; social network sites; continuous professional education	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; HEALTH; CARE; PARTICIPATION; ATTITUDES; WHATSAPP; IMPACT	Background: Social network sites (SNSs) are widely exploited in health education and communication by the general public, including patients with various conditions. Nevertheless, there is an absence of evidence evaluating SNSs in connecting health professionals for professional purposes. Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the feasibility of an intervention aiming to investigate the effects of a continuous professional education program utilizing Facebook to obtain knowledge on dementia and care for patients with dementia. Methods: Eighty health professionals from Hong Kong were recruited for participation in the study and randomized at a 1:1 ratio by a block randomization method to the intervention group (n=40) and control group (n=40). The intervention was an 8-week educational program developed to deliver updated knowledge on dementia care from a multidisciplinary perspective, either by Facebook (intervention group) or by email (control group) from October 2018 to January 2019. The primary outcomes were the effects of the intervention, measured by differences in the means of changes in pre- and postintervention scores of knowledge assessments from the 25-item Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS) and formative evaluation of 20 multiple choice questions. Other outcome measurements included participant compliance, participant engagement in Facebook, satisfaction, and self-perceived uses of Facebook for continuing professional education programs. Results: Significantly more intervention group participants (n=35) completed the study than the control group (n=25) (P<.001). The overall retention rate was 75% (60/80). The mean of changes in scores in the intervention group were significant in all assessments (P<.001). A significant difference in the mean of changes in scores between the two groups was identified in the DKAS subscale Communication and Behavior (95% CI 0.4-3.3, P=.02). There was no significant difference in the total DKAS scores, scores of other DKAS subscales, and multiple choice questions. Participant compliance was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P<.001). The mean numbers of participants accessing the learning materials were 31.5 (SD 3.9) and 17.6 (SD 5.2) in the intervention and control group, respectively. Polls attracted the highest level of participant engagement, followed by videos. Intervention group participants scored significantly higher in favoring the use of Facebook for the continuing education program (P=.03). Overall, participants were satisfied with the interventions (mean score 4 of a total of 5, SD 0.6). Conclusions: The significantly higher retention rate, together with the high levels of participant compliance and engagement, demonstrate that Facebook is a promising tool for professional education. Education delivered through Facebook was significantly more effective at improving participants' knowledge of how people with dementia communicate and behave. Participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward utilizing Facebook for professional learning.

However, in medicine and health care, a large number of stakeholders (eg, clinicians, administrators, professional colleges, academic institutions, ministries of health, among others) are unaware of social media's relevance, potential applications in their day-to-day activities, as well as the inherent risks and how these may be attenuated and mitigated. Objective: We conducted a narrative review with the aim to present case studies that illustrate how, where, and why social media are being used in the medical and health care sectors. Methods: Using a critical-interpretivist framework, we used qualitative methods to synthesize the impact and illustrate, explain, and provide contextual knowledge of the applications and potential implementations of social media in medicine and health care. Both traditional (eg, peer-reviewed) and nontraditional (eg, policies, case studies, and social media content) sources were used, in addition to an environmental scan (using Google and Bing Web searches) of resources. Results: We reviewed, evaluated, and synthesized 76 articles, 44 websites, and 11 policies/reports. Results and case studies are presented according to 10 different categories of social media: (1) blogs (eg, WordPress), (2) microblogs (eg, Twitter), (3) social networking sites (eg, Facebook), (4) professional networking sites (eg, LinkedIn, Sermo), (5) thematic networking sites (eg, 23andMe), (6) wikis (eg, Wikipedia), (7) mashups (eg, HealthMap), (8) collaborative filtering sites (eg, Digg), (9) media sharing sites (eg, YouTube, Slideshare), and others (eg, SecondLife). Four recommendations are provided and explained for stakeholders wishing to engage with social media while attenuating risk: (1) maintain professionalism at all times, (2) be authentic, have fun, and do not be afraid, (3) ask for help, and (4) focus, grab attention, and engage. Conclusions: The role of social media in the medical and health care sectors is far reaching, and many questions in terms of governance, ethics, professionalism, privacy, confidentiality, and information quality remain unanswered. By following the guidelines presented, professionals have a starting point to engage with social media in a safe and ethical manner. Future research will be required to understand the synergies between social media and evidence-based practice, as well as develop institutional policies that benefit patients, clinicians, public health practitioners, and industry alike.

Effects of Social Network Exposure on Nutritional Learning: Development of an Online Educational Platform	JMIR SERIOUS GAMES			English	Article						nutrition requirements; obesity; public health; social networking sites	HEALTH BEHAVIOR-CHANGE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; OBESITY; MEDIA; PREVENTION; SPREAD	Background: Social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook have the potential to enhance online public health interventions, in part, as they provide social exposure and reinforcement. Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate whether social exposure provided by SNSs enhances the effects of online public health interventions. Methods: As a sample intervention, we developed Food Hero, an online platform for nutritional education in which players feed a virtual character according to their own nutritional needs and complete a set of virtual sport challenges. The platform was developed in 2 versions: a "private version" in which a user can see only his or her own score, and a "social version" in which a user can see other players' scores, including preexisting Facebook friends. We assessed changes in participants' nutritional knowledge using 4 quiz scores and 3 menu-assembly scores. Monitoring feeding and exercising attempts assessed engagement with the platform. Results: The 2 versions of the platform were randomly assigned between a study group (30 members receiving the social version) and a control group (33 members, private version). The study group's performance on the quizzes gradually increased over time, relative to that of the control group, becoming significantly higher by the fourth quiz (P=. 02). Furthermore, the study group's menu-assembly scores improved over time compared to the first score, whereas the control group's performance deteriorated. Study group members spent an average of 3: 40 minutes assembling each menu compared to 2: 50 minutes in the control group, and performed an average of 1.58 daily sport challenges, compared to 1.21 in the control group (P=. 03). Conclusions: This work focused on isolating the SNSs' social effects in order to help guide future online interventions. Our results indicate that the social exposure provided by SNSs is associated with increased engagement and learning in an online nutritional educational platform.

Investigators Positive Brain Hlth	A longitudinal view of successful aging with HIV: role of resilience and environmental factors	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						HIV; Successful aging; Determinants of health; Resilience; Classification; Regression trees	INTERVENTIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEFINITIONS	Purpose The purpose of this study is to estimate the extent to which people aging with HIV meet criteria for successful aging as operationalized through HRQL and maintain this status over time. A second objective is to identify factors that place people at promise for continued successful aging, including environmental and resilience factors. Methods Participants were members of the Positive Brain Health Now (BHN) cohort. People >= 50 years (n = 513) were classified as aging successfully if they were at or above norms on 7 or 8 of 8 health-related quality of life domains from the RAND-36. Group-based trajectory analysis, regression tree analysis, a form of machine learning, and logistic regression were applied to identify factors predicting successful aging. Results 73 (14 center dot 2%) met criteria for successful aging at entry and did not change status over time. The most influential factor was loneliness which split the sample into two groups with the prevalence of successful aging 28 center dot 4% in the "almost never" lonely compared to 4 center dot 6% in the "sometimes/often" lonely group. Other influential factors were feeling safe, social network, motivation, stigma, and socioeconomic status. These factors identified 17 sub-groups with at least 30 members with the proportions classified as aging successfully ranging from 0 to 79 center dot 4%. The nine variables important to classifying successful aging had a predictive accuracy of 0.862. Self-reported cognition but not cognitive test performance improved this accuracy to 0.895. The two groups defined by successful aging status did not differ on age, sex or viral load, nadir and current. Conclusion The results indicate the important role of social determinants of health in successful aging among people living with HIV.

Objectives To derive SF-6D health state utilities (HSUs) for participants of the HOLISM (Health Outcomes and Lifestyle In a Sample of people with Multiple Sclerosis) international cohort and to describe the distribution and determinants thereof. Methods HSUs were generated using the SF-6D for participants with sufficient SF-36 data [n = 2185/2466 (88.6%)]. Mean HSUs for sociodemographic, clinical and modifiable lifestyle factors (including diet, physical activity, supplement use) were evaluated. Determinants of HSU were then evaluated by linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, MS type, disability, fatigue, and prescription antidepressant use. Results Mean HSU for the sample was 0.67 (SD = 0.13) and diminished with increasing MS-related disability, robust to adjustment, supporting the SF-6D's discriminatory power in people with MS. Severe disability and clinically significant fatigue were each associated with 11% lower HSU (95% CI = - 0.13, - 0.10 and - 0.12, - 0.10), and depression risk with 10%-lower HSU (95% CI = - 0.11, - 0.08). Employment, higher socioeconomic and married/partnered statuses, larger social-network size, greater physical activity, and vitamin D and omega-3 supplement use were associated with significantly higher HSU, and overweight/obese BMI and tobacco smoking with lower HSU. Age, sex, and education were not associated. Conclusion Modifiable lifestyle factors including healthy diet, increased physical activity and supplement use were associated with higher HRQOL among people with MS. The SF-6D instrument revealed significant discriminatory power in this international cohort of people with MS.

Methods: We searched five databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Pubmed) from inception to September 2018 and reviewed 19 experimental and non-experimental studies of 21 technology-driven diet plus physical activity interventions for adults (>= 18 years) at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Behaviour change techniques were coded using the BCT taxonomy v1, and digital features were identified via thematic analysis of intervention descriptions. Results: Sixty-three per cent of interventions were effective in the short term (achieving >= 3% weight loss at <= 6 months), using an average of 5.6 more behaviour change techniques than non-effective interventions, and 33% were effective in the long term (achieving >= 5% weight loss at >= 12 months), using 3.7 more behaviour change techniques than non-effective interventions. The techniques of social support (unspecified), goal setting (outcome/behaviour), feedback on behaviour, and self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behaviour were identified in over 90% of effective interventions. Interventions containing digital features that facilitated health and lifestyle education, behaviour/outcome tracking, and/or online health coaching were most effective. Conclusion: The integration of specific behaviour change techniques and digital features may optimise digital diabetes prevention interventions to achieve clinically significant weight loss. Additional research is needed to identify the mechanisms in which behaviour change techniques and digital features directly influence physical activity, dietary behaviours, and intervention engagement.

J	Muller, AE; Skurtveit, S; Clausen, T				Muller, Ashley Elizabeth; Skurtveit, Svetlana; Clausen, Thomas			Performance of the WHOQOL-BREF among Norwegian substance use disorder patients	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Quality of life; Substance use disorder; Psychometrics; Social isolation	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SOCIAL NETWORK; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; GENERAL-POPULATION; DEPENDENT PEOPLE; ALCOHOL; DRUG; METHADONE; RECOVERY; SMOKING	BackgroundQuality of life (QoL) is an established outcome measure of substance use disorder treatment. The WHOQOL-BREF is the gold standard tool, but its appropriateness for particularly vulnerable patient populations must be further explored. This article examines the scaling qualities of the WHOQOL-BREF in a Norwegian substance use disorder population, and explores relationships with social and health variables.Methods107 participants in a larger national treatment study provided data during structured interviews. Item responses, responsiveness, and domain scaling qualities are reported. General linear models identified correlates of impaired QoL.ResultsThree out of four domains exhibited acceptable scaling qualities, while the social relationships domain had low internal validity. 59% of the variance in physical health QoL was explained in our model by the negative main or interaction effects of depression, unemployment, social isolation, smoking, residential treatment, and weight dissatisfaction. 52% of the variance in psychological health QoL was explained by depression and being single. Depression also had significant main effects in social relationships QoL (R-2=.27) and environment QoL (R-2=.39), and social isolation and exercise had further interaction effects in environment QoL.ConclusionsAfter one year in treatment, the impact of low social contact in reducing QoL, rather than specific substance use patterns, was striking. The social relationships domain is the shortest in the WHOQOL-BREF, yet social variables were important in other areas of QoL. Social support could benefit from more attention in treatment, as a lack of social support seems to be a strong risk factor for poor QoL in various domains.

J	Fonseka, LN; Woo, BKP				Fonseka, Lakshan N.; Woo, Benjamin K. P.			Consumer Wearables and the Integration of New Objective Measures in Oncology: Patient and Provider Perspectives	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						consumer; wearables; smartwatch; cancer; oncology; chemotherapy; apps	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CANCER SURVIVORS; RECOVERY; DEVICES	With one in five adults in the United States owning a smartwatch or fitness tracker, these devices are poised to impact all aspects of medicine by offering a more objective approach to replace self-reported data. Oncology has proved to be a prototypical example, and wearables offer immediate benefits to patients and oncologists with the ability to track symptoms and health metrics in real time. We aimed to review the recent literature on consumer-grade wearables and its current applications in cancer from the perspective of both the patient and the provider. The relevant studies suggested that these devices offer benefits, such as improved medication adherence and accuracy of symptom tracking over self-reported data, as well as insights that increase patient empowerment. Physical activity is consistently correlated with stronger patient outcomes, and a patient's real-time metrics were found to be capable of tracking medication side effects and toxicity. Studies have made associations between wearable data and telomere shortening, cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption, sleep apnea, and other conditions. The objective data obtained by the wearable presents a more complete picture of an individual's health than the snapshot of a 15-minute office visit and a single set of vital signs. Real-time metrics can be translated into a digital phenotype that identifies risk factors specific to each patient, and shared risk factors across one's social network may uncover common environmental exposures detrimental to one's health. Wearable data and its upcoming integration with social media will be the foundation for the next generation of personalized medicine.

A qualitative study	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						behaviour change; intervention; practices; self-management; social networks	SELF-MANAGEMENT; HEALTH; SUPPORT	Background Personal and community networks are recognized as influencing and shaping self-management activities and practices. An acceptable intervention which facilitates self-management by mobilizing network support and improves network engagement has a positive impact on health and quality of life. This study aims to identify the processes through which such changes and engagement take place. Methods The study was conducted in the south of England in 2016-2017 and adopted a longitudinal case study of networks design. Purposive sample of respondents with long-term conditions (n = 15) was recruited from local groups. Barriers and facilitators to implementation were explored in interviews with key stakeholders (5). Results Intervention engagement leads to a deepening of relationships within networks, adding new links and achieving personal objectives relevant for improving the health and well-being of users and network members. Such changes are supported through two pathways: the mobilization of network capabilities and by acting as a nudge. The first is a gradual process where potentially relevant changes are further contemplated by forefronting immediate concerns and negotiating acceptable means for achieving change, prioritizing objective over subjective valuations of support provided by network members and rehearsing justifications for keeping the status quo or adopting change. The second pathway changes are enacted through the availability of a potential fit between individual, network and environmental conditions of readiness. Conclusions The two pathways of network mobilization identified in this study illuminate the individual, network and environmental level processes involved in moving from cognitive engagement with the intervention to adopting changes in existing practice.

Social support has been identified as a significant factor in the successful adoption of lifestyle change for people with type 2 diabetes, however people with mental illness often have impoverished social networks leading to greater reliance upon professional care givers. This study maps the support provided by formal (paid and professional carers) and informal networks to people with mental illness and type 2 diabetes, comparing the experiences of people with a spouse with those without one. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 29 clients of a community nursing service with mental health problems who receive professional support to self-manage type 2 diabetes. Participants were asked to complete an egocentric social network map which involved mapping the people and services who support them to manage their health. Demographic data was collected as was data about co-morbidities and service use within the last 6 months. Network maps were supplemented by a series of open-ended questions about self-management practices, who supports these practices and what support they provide. Results: Participants identified small social networks with few friendship ties. These networks had diminished due to illness. For people with a spouse, this person provided significant support for chronic illness self-management performing a range of daily care and illness management tasks. People without a spouse were more reliant on professional and paid care givers for daily care and illness management. People without a spouse also demonstrated greater reliance upon weak social ties for emotional support and social connection and often developed friendships with formal caregivers. Conclusions: Spousal support reduces the need for professional services. In the absence of a spouse, participants were more reliant upon paid and professional carers and weaker social ties for chronic illness support and social connection leading to greater vulnerability of loss of support.

Characterizing communication patterns among members of the clinical care team to deliver breast cancer treatment	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						workflow; social networking; burnout; collaboration; breast cancer	NETWORK ANALYSIS; HEALTH; COORDINATION; PHYSICIANS; BURNOUT; SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT; COLLABORATION; PROVIDER; SYSTEM	Objective: Research to date focused on quantifying team collaboration has relied on identifying shared patients but does not incorporate the major role of communication patterns. The goal of this study was to describe the patterns and volume of communication among care team members involved in treating breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 4 years of communications data from the electronic health record between care team members at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Our cohort of patients diagnosed with breast cancer was identified using the VUMC tumor registry. We classified each care team member participating in electronic messaging by their institutional role and classified physicians by specialty. To identify collaborative patterns, we modeled the data as a social network. Results: Our cohort of 1181 patients was the subject of 322 424 messages sent in 104 210 unique communication threads by 5620 employees. On average, each patient was the subject of 88.2 message threads involving 106.4 employees. Each employee, on average, sent 72.9 messages and was connected to 24.6 collaborators. Nurses and physicians were involved in 98% and 44% of all message threads, respectively. Discussion and Conclusion: Our results suggest that many providers in our study may experience a high volume of messaging work. By using data routinely generated through interaction with the electronic health record, we can begin to evaluate how to iteratively implement and assess initiatives to improve the efficiency of care coordination and reduce unnecessary messaging work across all care team roles.

J	Alanzi, T				Alanzi, Turki			A Review of Mobile Applications Available in the App and Google Play Stores Used During the COVID-19 Outbreak	JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE			English	Review						COVID-19; pandemic; healthcare; m-health; e-health; mobile applications; virtual care; telehealth		Purpose: The objective of this paper was to review the functionalities and effectiveness of the free mobile health applications available in the Google Play and App stores used in Saudi Arabia, Italy, Singapore, the United Kingdom, USA, and India during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This study adopted a systematic search strategy to identify the free mobile applications available in the App and Google Play stores related to the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the PRISMA flowchart of the search, only 12 applications met the inclusion criterion. Results: The 12 mobile applications that met the inclusion criterion were: Mawid, Tabaud, Tawakkalna, Sehha, Aarogya setu, TraceTogether, COVID safe, Immuni, COVID symptom study, COVID watch, NHS COVID-19, and PathCheck. The following features and functionalities of the apps were described: app overview (price, ratings, android, iOS, developer/owner, country, status), health tools (user status-risk assessment, self-assessment, E-pass integration, test results reporting, online consultation, contact tracing), learning options (personalized notes, educational resources, COVID-19 information), communication tools (query resolution, appointments, social network, notifications), app design (data visualization, program plan), networking tools (location mapping - GPS, connectivity with other devices), and safety and security options (alerts, data protection). Also, the effectiveness of the apps was analyzed. Conclusion: The analysis revealed that various applications have been developed for different functions like contact tracing, awareness building, appointment booking, online consultation, etc. However, only a few applications have integrated various functions and features such as self-assessment, consultation, support and access to information. Also, most of the apps are focused on contact tracing, while very few are dedicated to raising awareness and sharing information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Likewise, the majority of applications rely on GPS and Bluetooth technologies for relevant functions. No apps were identified that had built-in social media features. It is suggested to design and develop an integrated mobile health application with most of the features and functionalities analyzed in this study.

Although intuition provides a number of mitigation strategies that may be effective, they remain largely untested. A system was developed to test a given disease mitigation strategy. It is designed to work with a graph representing a real social network. A Genetic Programming system was used to discover novel mitigation strategies that are easily interpretable by a public health decision maker. Effective strategies were developed by the GP system. The strategies are easily explainable and intuitive. Novel mitigation strategies were compared to simple baseline strategies with varying success using a number of different metrics. Many of these strategies proved effective in general, however the topology of the graph influences the effectiveness of a strategy. The system has been made publicly available and the authors call on the research community to contribute their own mitigation strategies and measure their efficacy.

Social networks, social support and social negativity: A qualitative study of head and neck cancer caregivers' experiences	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE			English	Article						caregiver; carer; head and neck; qualitative; social network; social support	HEALTH; TIES; ACTIVATION; PARTNERS; PATIENT	Head and neck cancer is a serious form of cancer that can generate substantial physical and psychosocial morbidity. Informal caregivers can help patients to manage head and neck cancer and its emotional impacts, both during and after treatment. Caregivers, however, can experience considerable stress as a result of their caring activities. Supportive relationships can protect caregivers from psychosocial strain. Thirty-one head and neck cancer caregivers were interviewed about their experiences of accessing social support from their social networks; difficulties that they experienced accessing this support; and strategies that they used to address these difficulties. Results suggest that head and neck cancer caregivers strongly value social support, but can find it difficult to obtain, and a number of them experience socially negative responses from their networks. Some carers attempt to answer or supplement support deficiencies by turning to non-human coping supports, such as pets, spiritual figures or medication. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Artur; Wynn, Rolf; Armayones, Manuel			Avatars using computer/smartphone mediated communication and social networking in prevention of sexually transmitted diseases among North-Norwegian youngsters	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Sexually transmitted diseases; Chlamydia; Health information technologies; Internet; Health education; Social network; Social media; Young adult; Adolescent	SELF-REPRESENTATION; ONLINE; REINFORCEMENT	Background: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), especially the Chlamydia trachomatis bacterial infection, a common cause of infertility, are highly prevalent in developed countries, and a worrying problem in North Norway, where the incidence of chlamydia twice the Norwegian average. Seventy percent of reported chlamydia cases are found in people below 25 years of age, and although its spread could be controlled with proper prevention, young people are more aware of the risks of unwanted pregnancy than their risk of acquiring a STD. Information and Communication Technologies, including, the Internet, social media and/or smartphones, should be valued for sexual health promotion for their potential to engage young audiences. And in these media, avatars guarantee anonymity to users when handling sensitive information. The main objective of this project is to achieve that North Norwegian youngsters become more aware of STDs through the use of popular technologies among young people. Methods: A Virtual Clinic for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (VCSTD) will be developed. The VCSTD will provide early guidance and reliable information sources concerning reproductive health, delivered in a novel and innovative way to the younger population. The VCSTD consists of an "avatar" supported intervention in a serious gaming and e-learning environment, which will bypass direct physical access (in person) to reliable medical information, as well as allowing the youngsters to share that information in social media, and thus helping the VCSTD to be disseminated to more people. Data analyses will be conducted on publically available health data relevant to STDs in Troms and Finnmark, like the absolute number of chlamydia tests, the amount of emergency contraception medication sold, and the number of abortions. Also, usage data of the system and experiences of usefulness will be explored through participants' voluntary responses to a feedback form available in the VCSTD. Discussion: This study will examine the usefulness of an online public health intervention that aims to promote healthy sexual practices among North-Norwegian youngsters. If shown to be effective, the intervention could prove to be an affordable and widely accessible intervention to decrease risky sexual practices in younger population.	[Gabarron, Elia; Serrano, J.

Research has examined characteristics of individuals engaging in online communities, whereas little is known about discontinuation of engagement and the phenomenon of participants dropping out of these communities. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of dropout behaviors among eating disordered individuals on Twitter and to estimate the causal effects of personal emotions and social networks on dropout behaviors. Methods: Using a snowball sampling method, we collected a set of individuals who self-identified with EDs in their Twitter profile descriptions, as well as their tweets and social networks, leading to 241,243,043 tweets from 208,063 users. Individuals' emotions are measured from their language use in tweets using an automatic sentiment analysis tool, and network centralities are measured from users' following networks. Dropout statuses of users are observed in a follow-up period 1.5 years later (from February 11, 2016 to August 17, 2017). Linear and survival regression instrumental variables models are used to estimate the effects of emotions and network centrality on dropout behaviors. The average levels of attributes among an individual's followees (ie, people who are followed by the individual) are used as instruments for the individual's attributes. Results: Eating disordered users have relatively short periods of activity on Twitter with one half of our sample dropping out at 6 months after account creation. Active users show more negative emotions and higher network centralities than dropped-out users. Active users tend to connect to other active users, whereas dropped-out users tend to cluster together. Estimation results suggest that users' emotions and network centralities have causal effects on their dropout behaviors on Twitter. More specifically, users with positive emotions are more likely to drop out and have shorter lasting periods of activity online than users with negative emotions, whereas central users in a social network have longer lasting participation than peripheral users. Findings on users' tweeting interests further show that users who attempt to recover from EDs are more likely to drop out than those who promote EDs as a lifestyle choice. Conclusions: Presence in online communities is strongly determined by the individual's emotions and social networks, suggesting that studies analyzing and trying to draw condition and population characteristics through online health communities are likely to be biased. Future research needs to examine in more detail the links between individual characteristics and participation patterns if better understanding of the entire population is to be achieved. At the same time, such attrition dynamics need to be acknowledged and controlled when designing online interventions so as to accurately capture their intended populations.

Objective: This study aims to examine successes, challenges, and lessons learned from using social media within health research and to create practical considerations to guide other researchers. Methods: The Knowledge Translation Platform of the Alberta Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research SUPPORT Unit formed a national working group involving platform staff, academics, and a parent representative with experience using social media for health research. We collected and analyzed 4 case studies that used a variety of social media platforms and evaluation methods. The case studies covered a spectrum of initiatives from participant recruitment and data collection to dissemination, engagement, and evaluation. Methods and findings from each case study as well as barriers and facilitators encountered were summarized Through iterative discussions, we converged on recommendations and considerations for health researchers planning to use social media for KT. Results: We provide recommendations for elements to consider when developing a social media KT strategy: (1) set a clear goal and identify a theory, framework, or model that aligns with the project goals and objectives; (2) understand the intended audience (use social network mapping to learn what platforms and social influences are available); (3) choose a platform or platforms that meet the needs of the intended audience and align well with the research team's capabilities (can you tap into an existing network, and what mode of communication does it support?); (4) tailor messages to meet user needs and platform requirements (eg, plain language and word restrictions); (5) consider timing, frequency, and duration of messaging as well as the nature of interactions (ie, social filtering and negotiated awareness); (6) ensure adequate resources and personnel are available (eg, content creators, project coordinators, communications experts, and audience stakeholder or patient advocate); (7) develop an evaluation plan a priori driven by goals and types of data available (ie, quantitative and qualitative); and (8) consider ethical approvals needed (driven by evaluation and type of data collection). Conclusions: In the absence of a comprehensive framework to guide health researchers using social media for KT, we provide several key considerations. Future research will help validate the proposed components and create a body of evidence around best practices for using and evaluating social media as part of a KT strategy	[Elliott, Sarah A.; Dyson, Michele P.; Hartling, Lisa] Univ Alberta, Alberta Res Ctr Hlth Evidence, Dept Pediat, 11405-87 Ave Edmonton, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Elliott, Sarah A.; Zimmermann, Gabrielle L.; Thomson, Denise; Hartling, Lisa] Univ Alberta, Dept Pediat, Alberta SPOR SUPPORT Unit, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Elliott, Sarah A.; Thomson, Denise; Hartling, Lisa] Cochrane Child Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Wilkes, Gilbert, V] Mt Royal Univ, Sch Commun Studies, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Zimmermann, Gabrielle L.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Chambers, Christine T.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Chambers, Christine T.] IWK Hlth Ctr, Ctr Pediat Pain Res, Hallifax, NS, Canada; [Wittmeier, Kristy] Univ Manitoba, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Pediat & Child Hlth, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Wittmeier, Kristy] Childrens Hosp Res Inst Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Russell, Dianne J.] McMaster Univ, CanChild Ctr Childhood Disabil Res, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Scott, Shannon D.] Univ Alberta, Fac Nursing, Edmonton, AB, Canada	Elliott, SA (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Alberta Res Ctr Hlth Evidence, Dept Pediat, 11405-87 Ave Edmonton, Edmonton, AB, Canada.	se2@ualberta.ca	; Chambers, Christine/I-2811-2014	Thomson, Denise/0000-0002-4972-5331; Chambers, Christine/0000-0002-7138-916X; Scott, Shannon/0000-0002-2251-3742; Elliott, Sarah/0000-0001-9588-2226; Russell, Dianne/0000-0001-7486-4643	Alberta SPOR SUPPORT Unit Knowledge Translation Platform - Alberta Innovates; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); University of Manitoba	The authors would like to thank Ms Megan Nuspl for helping initially coordinate the project and Ms Jennifer Sprung for providing a parent perspective on important outcomes for successful end-user engagement.

J	Nimmon, L; Atherley, A				Nimmon, Laura; Atherley, Anique			Qualitative ego networks in health professions education: Capturing the self in relation to others	MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access							COMPLEXITY	Introduction Our very sense of self emerges through interactions with others. As part of this State of the Science series on Self, Society, and Situation, we introduce a qualitative ego network research approach. This research approach offers insights into the self's (the ego's) interpretation of and relation to named others in the social network in question. Purpose Visual mapping of participants' social networks is gaining traction, yet this research approach has received no focused attention in the health professions education (HPE) literature. A qualitative ego network approach is a compelling research approach because it uniquely maps participants' perceptions of the complex social world they are embedded in. Although many methodologies can explore participants' social world, ego networks can enhance expression of tacit knowledge of one's social environment and encourage reflection. This approach, combined with other qualitative data, can also reveal hidden relational data that the researcher may not observe or consider. To demonstrate its value as a visual methodology, we will showcase two examples of qualitative ego network studies. We then balance the paper with some critical reflections of this research approach. Conclusions A qualitative ego network approach holds potential for deepening understanding of the self in relation to society and situation in future HPE research. We look forward to intentional, impactful and invigorated research using a qualitative ego network approach as we tackle unknowns about how self and society in specific HPE situations interact.

J	Black, E; Light, J; Black, NP; Thompson, L				Black, Erik; Light, Jennifer; Black, Nicole Paradise; Thompson, Lindsay			Online Social Network Use by Health Care Providers in a High Traffic Patient Care Environment	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social networking; emergency medicine; Internet	PERSONAL INTERNET USE; WORK	Background: The majority of workers, regardless of age or occupational status, report engaging in personal Internet use in the workplace. There is little understanding of the impact that personal Internet use may have on patient care in acute clinical settings. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the volume of one form of personal Internet use-online social networking (Facebook)-generated by workstations in the emergency department (ED) in contrast to measures of clinical volume and severity. Methods: The research team analyzed anonymous network utilization records for 68 workstations located in the emergency medicine department within one academic medical center for 15 consecutive days (12/29/2009 to 1/12/2010). This data was compared to ED work index (EDWIN) data derived by the hospital information systems. Results: Health care workers spent an accumulated 4349 minutes (72.5 hours) browsing Facebook, staff cumulatively visited Facebook 9369 times and spent, on average, 12.0 minutes per hour browsing Facebook. There was a statistically significant difference in the time spent on Facebook according to time of day (19.8 minutes per hour versus 4.3 minutes per hour, P<.001). There was a significant, positive correlation between EDWIN scores and time spent on Facebook (r=.266, P<.001). Conclusions: Facebook use constituted a substantive percentage of staff time during the 15-day observation period. Facebook use increased with increased patient volume and severity within the ED.

From a sample of 297 users with severe mental disorders from Montreal (Canada), this study aimed to identify the key predictors of subjective quality of life (SQOL). Methods: Users were recruited and interviewed from December 2008 to September 2010 and re-interviewed approximately 18 months later. A comprehensive framework including socio-demographic data, clinical, needs and functionality variables, negative life events, social support and healthcare service use, and appreciation data were considered as predictors. Clinical records and eight standardized instruments were used. Results: Lower severity of needs, schizophrenia, better social integration, better reassurance of worth, fewer drug abuse problems, and living in supervised housing are predictors of SQOL. With regard to needs, absence or lower severity of needs in the areas of company, daytime activities, social exclusion, safety to self, and benefits are linked to SQOL. Conclusion: Reducing the severity of needs is especially beneficial to ensure a higher SQOL for users with severe mental disorders. To improve SQOL, priority must be given to programs and interventions that promote the development of a stimulating and supportive social network, and maintain a plurality of residential services matching the functional abilities of users.

In Guatemala, multiple barriers prevent access to healthcare services for rural and indigenous populations, and strategies for delivering healthcare in more efficient ways are needed. The case study we describe here is a unique collaboration between a microfinance institution (Friendship Bridge) and a primary care organization (Wuqu' Kawoq vertical bar Maya Health Alliance) to scale up healthcare through an existing lending-borrowing social network. The program provides primary care services to female clients of Friendship Bridge in rural areas of Guatemala, with nurses working as frontline primary care providers, providing door-to-door healthcare services. Over the first 22 months of the project, we have reached over 3500 of Friendship Bridge's clients, with overall high acceptance of services. All clinical documentation and program monitoring and evaluation are done through audit trails within an electronical medical record system, which improves efficiency and lowers the associated time and resources costs. We utilize quality improvement methodologies to aid in decision making and programmatic adjustments scale up. These strategies have allowed us to expand services rapidly under challenging geographic and logistical constraints, while concurrently iteratively improving staff training and supervision, clinical care, and client engagement processes.

Depressive symptoms during adverse economic and political circumstances: A comparative study on Greek female breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE			English	Article						breast cancer; chemotherapy; debt crisis; depression; Greece; Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology	SYMPTOMATOLOGY IDS; RISK; METAANALYSIS; PREVALENCE; ANXIETY; WOMEN; INVENTORY; DISEASE; HEALTH	The aim of this study was to search for an effect of the adverse economic and political events that took place in 2015 in Greece (threat of bankruptcy, referendum, capital controls) on depressive symptoms of breast cancer patients on chemotherapy. The clinician-rated version of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30) and a form documenting sociodemographic, medical and social network characteristics were administrated in two groups of patients: one in 2010 and one in the aftermath of the July 2015 events. No differences were found between medical, demographic and social characteristics. The IDS-C30 median value of patients treated in 2010 was 28.07 (CI, 25.91-31.60), while that of the 2015's group was 18.00 (CI, 16.92-20.60), indicating less depressive symptoms for the second group. The analysis revealed that the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (p=<.001), denoting a strong effect size (r=.53). Lower depressive symptoms after the July 2015 events could be explained by different personal and social factors- most possibly an increase of social support to the most vulnerableyet to be proven. Future research on the effect of striking economic and political events on mental health of a larger cohort of breast cancer patients is warranted.

Online support groups for head and neck cancer and health-related quality of life	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Head and neck cancer; Online support; Quality of life; Adjustment; Empowerment	BREAST-CANCER; SELF-EFFICACY; SOCIAL NETWORKS; EMPOWERING PROCESSES; MENTAL ADJUSTMENT; DEPRESSION SCALE; HOSPITAL ANXIETY; INTERNET USE; HIV/AIDS; EPIDEMIOLOGY	To investigate the association between using online support groups (OSGs) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and the psychosocial factors that may influence this association among individuals with head and neck (H&N) cancer. A sample of 199 persons with H&N cancer using four OSGs completed an online questionnaire using six pre-validated measures for social network, self-efficacy, anxiety and depression, adjustment, empowerment and quality of life. In addition, socio-demographic as well as illness-related and OSGs-related information was collected. Participants who had better HRQoL had been using OSGs for a longer time than those who had worse HRQoL (B = 0.07, p < 0.05). Depression and adjustment were the only direct mediators in this association, whereas self-efficacy, anxiety and empowerment appeared as indirect mediators. Participation in OSGs was found to be associated to better HRQoL either directly or indirectly through decreasing depression, anxiety and the negative adjustment behaviours and increasing self-efficacy and empowerment of the users. The study presented a potential model of pathways linking OSG use and HRQoL for those with H&N cancer. However, the model needs to be tested in future longitudinal studies and the associations proposed need to be explored in greater detail.

To ensure patient care is administered correctly, it is necessary for medical treatment teams to be both multidisciplinary and cohesive. The analysis of health processes is a constant challenge due to their high variability and complexity. This paper proposes a method based on the analysis of social networks to detect treatment networks, and to identify a relationship between these networks and patient evolution, as measured by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The networks were segmented based on patient adherence to their medical appointments and their mean time of delay. We applied this method on a sample of 1574 patients diagnosed with T2DM. Results show that participatory treatment -in which a patient sees a particular group of professionals on a recurrent basis - together with high levels of adherence are associated to those patients who improve their HbA1c levels in the case of high levels of adherence, while those who continually experience referrals to different professionals, remain unstable and, in some cases, get worse. On the other hand, in order to maintain a patient as stable, continuous control of the patient is enough, regardless of the recurrence to the same professionals.

Two challenges are faced in doing so, one of which is that some different authors will have the same name in the bibliometric data, and the second is that coauthors' contributions are different in the article byline. No study has dealt with the matter of duplicate names in bibliometric data. Although betweenness centrality (BC) is one of the most popular degrees of density in social network analysis (SNA), few have applied the BC algorithm to interpret a network's characteristics. A quantitative scheme must be used for calculating weighted author credits and then applying the metrics in comparison. Objective: This study aimed to apply the BC algorithm to examine possible identical names in a network and report the most-cited authors for a journal related to international mobile health (mHealth) research. Methods: We obtained 676 abstracts from Medline based on the keywords "JMIR mHealth and uHealth" (Journal) on June 30, 2018. The author names, countries/areas, and author-defined keywords were recorded. The BCs were then calculated for the following: (1) the most-cited authors displayed on Google Maps; (2) the geographical distribution of countries/areas for the first author; and (3) the keywords dispersed by BC and related to article topics in comparison on citation indices. Pajek software was used to yield the BC for each entity (or node). Bibliometric indices, including h-, g-, and x-indexes, the mean of core articles on g(Ag)=sum (citations on g-core/publications on g-core), and author impact factor (AIF), were applied. Results: We found that the most-cited author was Sherif M Badawy (from the United States), who had published six articles on JMIR mHealth and uHealth with high bibliometric indices (h=3; AIF=8.47; x=4.68; Ag=5.26). We also found that the two countries with the highest BC were the United States and the United Kingdom and that the two keyword clusters of mHealth and telemedicine earned the highest indices in comparison to other counterparts. All visual representations were successfully displayed on Google Maps. Conclusions: The most cited authors were selected using the authorship-weighted scheme (AWS), and the keywords of mHealth and telemedicine were more highly cited than other counterparts. The results on Google Maps are novel and unique as knowledge concept maps for understanding the feature of a journal. The research approaches used in this study (ie, BC and AWS) can be applied to other bibliometric analyses in the future.

J	Willard, S; van Rossum, E; Spreeuwenberg, M; de Witte, L				Willard, Sarah; van Rossum, Erik; Spreeuwenberg, Marieke; de Witte, Luc			Perceived Impact of an Online Community Care Platform for Dutch Older Adults on Local Participation, Informal Caregiving, and Feelings of Connectedness: Pretest-Posttest Observational Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						older adults; online community; online platform; social network; local participation; informal caregiving	NETHERLANDS	Background: In a changing ageing society wherein older adults are increasingly expected to take care of themselves instead of relying on health care services, online community care platforms can help older adults to meet these expectations. A considerable number of these online community care platforms have been introduced in several European countries based on their potential. However, their actual impact is unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the self-reported use, expectations, and perceived impact of a Dutch online community care platform called Grubbenvorst-Online among Dutch older adults. The following 2 questions were studied: (1) What is the self-reported use of Grubbenvorst-Online among older adults? (2) What are their expectations and perceived impact of Grubbenvorst-Online regarding local participation, their social network, mutual informal caregiving, and feelings of connectedness? Methods: An observational pretest-posttest study was conducted. Participants were recruited via a web-based message on the Grubbenvorst-Online platform and data were collected via postal questionnaires among older users at the start of the study and 4 months later. Data regarding the expectations and the perceived impact of Grubbenvorst-Online were compared and tested. Results: Forty-seven Grabbenvorst-Online users with an average age of 74 years participated in this study. They were healthy, predominantly "internet-skilled," and they found the internet important for maintaining social contacts. In general, the use of the online community care platform decreased during the 4-month follow-up period. The perceived impact of Grubbenvorst-Online was significantly lower than that expected regarding information provision (P=.003), seeking help from fellow villagers (P<.001), giving help to fellow villagers (P<.001), and consulting care or welfare services (P<.001). Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that online community care platforms perhaps do not provide enough "added value" in their current form. We suggest a new direction in which online community care platforms primarily support existing offline initiatives aimed at stimulating local participation, informal caregiving, and feelings of connectedness.

Objective: This study aimed to measure the ability of patients and members of their social network to complete checklists for complications of systemic treatment for cancer and examine the impact on patient-centered and health-economic outcomes. Methods: A prospective interventional cohort study was performed to assess the impact of a smartphone app used by patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy and members of their network to monitor for common complications. The app was used by patients, a nominated "safety buddy," and acute oncology services. The control group was made up of patients from the same institution. Measures were based on process (completion of checklists over 60 days), patient experience outcomes (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the General version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy at baseline, 1 month, and 2 months) and health-economic outcomes (usage of appointments in primary care and elective and unscheduled hospital admissions). Results: At the conclusion of the study, 50 patients had completed 2882 checklists, and their 50 "safety buddies" had completed 318 checklists. Near daily usage was maintained over the 60-day study period. When compared to a cohort of 50 patients with matching disease profiles from the same institution, patients in the intervention group had comparable changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and General version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy. Patients in the Intervention Group required a third (32 vs 97 nights) of the hospital days with overnight stay compared to patients in the Control Group, though the difference was not significant. The question, "I feel safer with the checklist," received a mean score of 4.27 (SD 0.87) on a Likert scale (1-5) for patients and 4.55 (SD 0.65) for family and friends. Conclusions: Patients undergoing treatment for cancer and their close contacts can complete checklists for common complications of systemic treatments and take an active role in systems supporting their own safety. A larger sample size will be needed to assess the impact on clinical outcomes and health economics.

J	Long, JC; Cunningham, FC; Carswell, P; Braithwaite, J				Long, Janet C.; Cunningham, Frances C.; Carswell, Peter; Braithwaite, Jeffrey			Patterns of collaboration in complex networks: the example of a translational research network	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Network theory; Collaboration; Translational research; Proximity; Brokerage; Health; Silos; Interorganisational alliances; Collaboratives for leadership in applied health research and care (CLAHRCs)	APPLIED HEALTH RESEARCH; INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION; KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; STRUCTURAL HOLES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; LEADERSHIP; PARTNERSHIPS; BOUNDARIES; INNOVATION; PROXIMITY	Background: This paper examines collaboration in a complex translational cancer research network (TRN) made up of a range of hospital-based clinicians and university-based researchers. We examine the phenomenon of close-knit and often introspective clusters of people (silos) and test the extent that factors associated with this clustering (geography, profession and past experience) influence patterns of current and future collaboration on TRN projects. Understanding more of these patterns, especially the gaps or barriers between members, will help network leaders to manage subgroups and promote connectivity crucial to efficient network function. Methods: An on-line, whole network survey was used to collect attribute and relationship data from all members of the new TRN based in New South Wales, Australia in early 2012. The 68 members were drawn from six separate hospital and university campuses. Social network analysis with UCInet tested the effects of geographic proximity, profession, past research experience, strength of ties and previous collaborations on past, present and future intended partnering. Results: Geographic proximity and past working relationships both had significant effects on the choice of current collaboration partners. Future intended collaborations included a significant number of weak ties and ties based on other members' reputations implying that the TRN has provided new opportunities for partnership. Professional grouping, a significant barrier discussed in the translational research literature, influenced past collaborations but not current or future collaborations, possibly through the mediation of network brokers. Conclusions: Since geographic proximity is important in the choice of collaborators a dispersed network such as this could consider enhancing cross site interactions by improving virtual communication technology and use, increasing social interactions apart from project related work, and maximising opportunities to meet members from other sites. Key network players have an important brokerage role facilitating linkages between groups.

"It's like a mirror image of my illness": Exploring Patient Perceptions About Illness Using Health Mind Mapping-a Qualitative Study	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						health mind mapping; explanatory models of illness; daily lived experiences; diabetes	SELF-MANAGEMENT; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; CULTURAL FORMULATION; EXPLANATORY MODELS; CARE; DISEASE; STRATEGIES; INTERVIEW; DRAWINGS; BARRIERS	A patient's self-management of chronic disease is influenced in part by their explanatory model of illness (EMI) and daily lived experiences (DLE). Unfortunately, assessing patient's EMI and using this information to engage patients in chronic illness self-management continues to be a challenge. "Health mind mapping" (HMM) is a novel process that captures a patient's EMI and DLE through the use of a graphic representation of ideas. We aimed to explore patient's experiences using HMM. Qualitative study utilizing semi-structured interviews. Adult patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes from a primary care clinic. A facilitator guided 20 participants through the process of developing a health mind map. Subsequently, each participant completed a semi-structured interview about their experience with the process and perceptions about how their maps could be used. The process and interviews were video and audio recorded. We conducted a content analysis of the maps and a thematic analysis, using an inductive approach, of the interview data. Participants explored a wide range of EMs and DLEs in their HMM process. Participants reported that the HMM process (1) helped to develop insight about self and illness; (2) was a catalyst for wanting to take actions to improve illness; and (3) represented an opportunity to actively share illness experiences. They reported potential uses of the map: (1) to communicate about their illness to others in their social network; (2) to communicate about their illness to providers; (3) to help others with diabetes manage their illness; and (4) to encourage ongoing engagement in diabetes self-care. Participants reported that HMM helped them develop new insight about their illness and was a catalyst for encouraging them to take control of their illness. HMM has the potential to facilitate communication with providers and engage patients in collaborative goal setting to improve self-care in chronic illness.

Objective: To determine the efficacy, engagement, and feasibility of an online social networking physical activity intervention with pedometers delivered via Facebook app. Methods: A total of 110 adults with a mean age of 35.6 years (SD 12.4) were recruited online in teams of 3 to 8 friends. Teams were randomly allocated to receive access to a 50-day online social networking physical activity intervention which included self-monitoring, social elements, and pedometers ("Active Team" Facebook app; n=51 individuals, 12 teams) or a wait-listed control condition (n=59 individuals, 13 teams). Assessments were undertaken online at baseline, 8 weeks, and 20 weeks. The primary outcome measure was self-reported weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Secondary outcomes were weekly walking, vigorous physical activity time, moderate physical activity time, overall quality of life, and mental health quality of life. Analyses were undertaken using random-effects mixed modeling, accounting for potential clustering at the team level. Usage statistics were reported descriptively to determine engagement and feasibility. Results: At the 8-week follow-up, the intervention participants had significantly increased their total weekly MVPA by 135 minutes relative to the control group (P=.03), due primarily to increases in walking time (155 min/week increase relative to controls, P<.001). However, statistical differences between groups for total weekly MVPA and walking time were lost at the 20-week follow-up. There were no significant changes in vigorous physical activity, nor overall quality of life or mental health quality of life at either time point. High levels of engagement with the intervention, and particularly the self-monitoring features, were observed. Conclusions: An online, social networking physical activity intervention with pedometers can produce sizable short-term physical activity changes. Future work is needed to determine how to maintain behavior change in the longer term, how to reach at-need populations, and how to disseminate such interventions on a mass scale.

In the field of health monitoring, this development may offer new opportunities for supervising a patient's health status by collecting objective, unobtrusive data about their daily social interactions. However, before considering this future perspective, whether and how similar results could be observed in other populations, including older ones, should be established. Objective: This study was designed specifically to address the circadian rhythms in the telephone calls of older adults. Methods: A longitudinal, 12-month dataset combining CDRs and questionnaire data from 26 volunteers aged 65 years or older was used to examine individual differences in the daily rhythms of telephone call activity. The study used outgoing CDRs only and worked with three specific telecommunication parameters: (1) call recipient (alter), (2) time of day, and (3) call duration. As did the studies involving young adults, we analyzed three issues: (1) the existence of circadian rhythms in the telephone call activity of older adults, (2) their persistence over time, and (3) the alter-specificity of calls by calculating relative entropy. Results: We discovered that older adults had their own specific circadian rhythms of outgoing telephone call activity whose salient features and preferences varied across individuals, from morning until night. We demonstrated that rhythms were consistent, as reflected by their persistence over time. Finally, results suggested that the circadian rhythms of outgoing telephone call activity were partly structured by how older adults allocated their communication time across their social network. Conclusions: Overall, these results are the first to have demonstrated the existence, persistence, and alter-specificity of the circadian rhythms of the outgoing telephone call activity of older adults. These findings suggest an opportunity to consider modern telephone technologies as potential sensors of daily activity. From a health care perspective, these sensors could be harnessed for unobtrusive monitoring purposes.

Objective: The objective of this study was to discriminate important features for identifying users' social support needs based on knowledge gathered from survey data. This study also provides guidelines for a technical framework, which can be used to predict users' social support needs based on raw data collected from OHSNs. Methods: We initially conducted a Web-based survey with 184 OHSN users. From this survey data, we extracted 34 features based on 5 categories: (1) demographics, (2) reading behavior, (3) posting behavior, (4) perceived roles in OHSNs, and (5) values sought in OHSNs. Features from the first 4 categories were used as variables for binary classification. For the prediction outcomes, we used features from the last category: the needs for emotional support, experience-based information, unconventional information, and medical facts. We compared 5 binary classifier algorithms: gradient boosting tree, random forest, decision tree, support vector machines, and logistic regression. We then calculated the scores of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) to understand the comparative effectiveness of the used features. Results: The best performance was AUC scores of 0.89 for predicting users seeking emotional support, 0.86 for experience-based information, 0.80 for unconventional information, and 0.83 for medical facts. With the gradient boosting tree as our best performing model, we analyzed the strength of individual features in predicting one's social support need. Among other discoveries, we found that users seeking emotional support tend to post more in OHSNs compared with others. Conclusions: We developed an initial framework for automatically predicting social support needs in OHSNs using survey data. Future work should involve nonsurvey data to evaluate the feasibility of the framework. Our study contributes to providing personalized social support in OHSNs.

Students worked in interprofessional teams to plan and implement a social skills training program for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The objectives were to provide a hands-on, student-led clinical experience; facilitate interprofessional collaborative learning through leadership partnerships and teach children with ASD to engage in appropriate social skill behaviors. Concurrently, faculty performed qualitative research to explore how the students worked together to provide intervention to the children. Data were collected via interview, direct observation of student planning sessions and student interprofessional interactions, and collection of posts from an online social network site used for session planning. There were six student participants and two faculty participants. Four themes emerged: learning who I am as a professional, learning to appreciate our professional differences, learning to communicate with each other and figuring it out, for the benefit of the kids. This interprofessional clinical learning experience and research helps ensure that students are adequately prepared to represent their profession as part of a diverse interprofessional health care team.

Social contagion theory: examining dynamic social networks and human behavior	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Review						social networks; contagion; human behavior; homophily; causal interence	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PEER INFLUENCE; SMOKING; SPREAD; SELECTION; TIME; PREVENTION; BIAS; IDENTIFICATION; COOPERATION	Here, we review the research we have conducted on social contagion. We describe the methods we have employed (and the assumptions they have entailed) to examine several datasets with complementary strengths and weaknesses, including the Framingham Heart Study, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and other observational and experimental datasets that we and others have collected. We describe the regularities that led us to propose that human social networks may exhibit a three degrees of influence property, and we review statistical approaches we have used to characterize interpersonal influence with respect to phenomena as diverse as obesity, smoking, cooperation, and happiness. We do not claim that this work is the final word, but we do believe that it provides some novel, informative, and stimulating evidence regarding social contagion in longitudinally followed networks. Along with other scholars, we are working to develop new methods for identifying causal effects using social network data, and we believe that this area is ripe for statistical development as current methods have known and often unavoidable limitations.

Improving the experience of dementia and enhancing active life - living well with dementia: study protocol for the IDEAL study	HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES			English	Article						Quality of life; Life satisfaction; Well-being; Person with dementia; Carer; Alzheimer's disease; Vascular dementia; Fronto-temporal dementia; Parkinson's disease dementia; Lewy body dementia	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; EARLY-STAGE DEMENTIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; SOCIAL NETWORK; OLDER-ADULTS; PEOPLE; CARE; HEALTH; PREDICTORS	Background: Enabling people with dementia and carers to 'live well' with the condition is a key United Kingdom policy objective. The aim of this project is to identify what helps people to live well or makes it difficult to live well in the context of having dementia or caring for a person with dementia, and to understand what 'living well' means from the perspective of people with dementia and carers. Methods/Design: Over a two-year period, 1500 people with early-stage dementia throughout Great Britain will be recruited to the study, together with a carer wherever possible. All the participants will be visited at home initially and again 12 months and 24 months later. This will provide information about the way in which well-being, life satisfaction and quality of life are affected by social capitals, assets and resources, the challenges posed by dementia, and the ways in which people adjust to and cope with these challenges. A smaller group will be interviewed in more depth. Discussion: The findings will lead to recommendations about what can be done by individuals, communities, health and social care practitioners, care providers and policy-makers to improve the likelihood of living well with dementia.

However, little is known about the preferences and needs of people with dementia living at home. Including people with dementia and their informal caregivers in research and policy creation could help to identify necessary forms of support, and tailor care to their personal preferences and needs. ObjectiveTo identify important components of in-home care for persons with dementia and their informal caregivers in the Netherlands. DesignSemi-structured interviews across the Netherlands, between March and June 2019 using thematic analysis. Setting and participantsPersons with dementia (n = 5) and informal caregivers (n = 14) were primarily recruited through dementia care organizations. Additionally, a case manager was recruited to reflect upon the semi-structured interviews findings. ResultsFive themes concerning important care components were identified including the need for: a social network, formal care, information, emotional support and easier access to care. The complexity of the dementia care system posed a common difficulty for persons with dementia and informal caregivers. ConclusionThis study suggests that a dementia care package should be developed that includes both informal and formal care, the provision of information and emotional support, and help with access to care. The creation of this care package could help to tailor dementia care to the preferences and needs of the persons with dementia and their informal caregivers.

To perform clinical interventions, knowledge distributed across units, directorates and individuals needs to be integrated. Formal and/or informal mechanisms may be used to coordinate knowledge and tasks within organizations. Although the literature has recently considered the role of physicians' professional networks in the diffusion of knowledge, several concerns remain about the mechanisms through which these networks emerge within healthcare organizations. The aim of the present paper is to explore the impact of institutional and professional homophilies on the formation of interphysician professional networks. Methods: We collected data on a community of around 300 physicians working at a local health authority within the Italian National Health Service. We employed multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures to explore the extent to which institutional and professional homophilies influence the formation of interphysician networks. Results: We found that both institutional and professional homophilies matter in explaining interphysician networks. Physicians who had similar fields of interest or belonged to the same organizational structure were more likely to establish professional relationships. In addition, professional homophily was more relevant than institutional affiliation in explaining collaborative ties. Conclusions: Our findings have organizational implications and provide useful information for managers who are responsible for undertaking organizational restructuring. Healthcare executives and administrators may want to consider the structure of advice networks while adopting new organizational structures.

In order to improve access of the poor to public resources, it is necessary to create a better governance system and effective policy-making. The purpose of this study is to improve network effectiveness of the Iranian health system and to design a financial protection network for the poor, based on the network governance theory. Methods We are using a quantitative method framework in conjunction with a Social network analysis (SNA) strategy. To draw an optimal network, we conducted interviews with experts by focusing on the arrangement and relationship among different institutions. The research sample was purposefully selected. We used UCINET software for data analysis and NetDraw software to draw networks. Results In this article, an optimal network was proposed with the following characteristics: First, the problem of the density of relationships among several central institutions and the isolation of the other institutions have been solved. Second, in our model, the relationships have been distributed in a balanced manner among all institutions in the network. Third, the number of participants has been reduced and consensus on poor people support policies has been achieved in this optimal network. Forth, executive organizations keep their central positions and upper institutions are not at the central position, so that the power is distributed in favor of more balanced governance. However, in order to increase efficiency and to have coherent decision-making, it is necessary to establish a "core" for this optimal network. The "core" has to include the organizations with the most relationship with others. Conclusion The result revealed that the usefulness of network analysis as a tool for proposing the effectiveness of governance. By strengthening the relationship among the main actors, an organized system of network management can be achieved. The network has to include all actors from different levels, from policy-making to implementation. The network also has to clarify the tasks from identifying the poor to covering costs. From an academic perspective, this study showed the adequacy of network analysis as a tool for policy sciences. Governance in our optimal health financial protection model follows the shared-governance pattern due to its high density, low centralization and low distance. The model of network governance can be the source of changes in the health governance system. It is a necessary structural condition to provide access to universal health coverage.

Evaluation of a Training Program to Improve Organizational Capacity for Health Systems Analytics	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						clinical informatics; education; analytics; professional training; workforce	SOCIAL NETWORK; INFORMATICS CURRICULUM; RECOMMENDATIONS; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT	Objective The Leadership in Analytics and Data Science (LEADS) course was evaluated for effectiveness. LEADS was a 6-month program for working biomedical and health informatics (BMHI) professionals designed to improve analytics skills, knowledge of enterprise applications, data stewardship, and to foster an analytics community of practice through lectures, hands-on skill building workshops, networking events, and small group projects. Methods The effectiveness of the LEADS course was evaluated using the Kirkpatrick Model by assessing pre- and postcourse knowledge, analytics capabilities, goals, practice, class lecture reaction, and change in the size of participant professional networks. Differences in pre- and postcourse responses were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine significance, and effect sizes were computed using a z-statistic. Results Twenty-nine students completed the course with 96% of respondents reporting that they were "very" or "extremely" likely to recommend the course. Participants reported improvement in several analytics capabilities including Epic data warehousing ( p = 0.017), institutional review board policy ( p = 0.005), and data stewardship ( p = 0.007). Changes in practice patterns mirrored those in self-reported capability. On average, the participant professional network doubled. Conclusion LEADS was the first course targeted to working BMHI professional at a large academic medical center to have a formal effectiveness evaluation be published in the literature. The course achieved the goals of expansion of BMHI knowledge, skills, and professional networks. The LEADS course provides a template for continuing education of working BMHI professionals.

Manufacturers submit 99.9% of these reports. We test online social networks as a complementary source to traditional FDA reporting of device-related adverse events. Methods Participatory surveillance of members of a non-profit online social network, TuDiabetes.org, from October 2011 to September 2012. Subjects were volunteers from a group within TuDiabetes, actively engaged online in participatory surveillance. They used the free TuAnalyze app, a privacy-preserving method to report detailed clinical information, available through the network. Network members were polled about finger-stick blood glucose monitors, continuous glucose monitors, and insulin delivery devices, including insulin pumps and insulin pens. Results Of 549 participants, 75 reported device-related adverse events, nearly half (48.0%) requiring intervention from another person to manage the event. Only three (4.0%) of these were reported by participants to the FDA. All TuAnalyze reports contained outcome information compared with 22% of reports to the FDA. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were experienced by 48.0% and 49.3% of participants, respectively. Discussion Members of an online community readily engaged in participatory surveillance. While polling distributed online populations does not yield generalizable, denominator-based rates, this approach can characterize risk within online communities using a bidirectional communication channel that enables reach-back and intervention. Conclusions Engagement of distributed communities in social networks is a viable complementary approach to traditional public health surveillance for adverse events related to medical devices.

We assessed QoL with the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA), CoC with the CONTINUUM, the therapeutic relationship with the Therapeutic Relationship in Community Mental Health Care (STAR-P) and developed a simple scale to measure unmet service needs.ResultsOutpatients with SMI (n=155) reported significantly better QoL than those with non-SMI (n=835) (p=0.003). In both groups, QoL was positively associated with cohabitation (p=0.007 for non-SMI and p=0.022 for SMI), good contact with family and friends (p<0.001 for both) and positive ratings of CoC (p<0.001 for non-SMI and p=0.008 for SMI). A positive association between QoL and therapeutic relationship (p=0.001) and a negative association between QoL and unmet needs for treatment (p=0.009) and activity (p=0.005) was only found in the non-SMI group.ConclusionOur study highlights the important differences between those with SMI and those with non-SMI in their reported QoL and in the relationship between QoL and service satisfaction, with only non-SMI patients' QoL influenced by the therapeutic relationship and unmet needs for treatment and activity. It also shows the importance of continuity of care and social factors for good QoL for both groups.

Methods: For a convenient sample of 100 surgical colorectal cancer patients, we used time-stamped EHR access-log data extracted from an academic medical center's EHR system to construct communication networks among healthcare professionals (HCPs) in each patient's virtual care team. We measured communication linkages between HCPs using the inverse of the average time between access events in which the source HCPs sent information to and the destination HCPs retrieved information from the EHR system. Social network analysis was used to examine and visualize communication network structures, identify principal care teams, and detect meaningful structural differences across networks. We conducted a non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test the association between care teams' communication network structures and patients' cancer stage and site. Results: The 100 communication networks showed substantial variations in size and structures. Principal care teams, the subset of HCPs who formed the core of the communication networks, had higher proportions of nurses, physicians, and pharmacists and a lower proportion of laboratory medical technologists than the overall networks. The distributions of conditional uniform graph quantiles suggested that our network-construction technique captured meaningful underlying structures that were different from random unstructured networks. MANOVA results found that the networks' topologies were associated with patients' cancer stage and site. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that it is feasible to use EHR access-log data to measure and examine communication networks in virtual care teams. The proposed methods captured salient communication patterns in care teams that were associated with patients' clinical differences.

J	Betsch, C; Renkewitz, F; Haase, N				Betsch, Cornelia; Renkewitz, Frank; Haase, Niels			Effect of Narrative Reports about Vaccine Adverse Events and Bias-Awareness Disclaimers on Vaccine Decisions: A Simulation of an Online Patient Social Network	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Internet; online social networking; preventive health behavior; decision making; vaccination	RISK PERCEPTION; PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOR; HEALTH BEHAVIOR; INFORMATION; NUMERACY; COMMUNICATION; PERSUASION; FLUENCY; WORTH; WEB	Background. As the number of individuals who search for health information in interactive online environments is increasing, patient networks deserve more scientific attention. Objective. To quantitatively examine if and how reading statistical and/or narrative information as typically displayed in patient networks (e. g., patientslikeme.com) affects decisions for pharmaceuticals. Previous work suggests that narrative information (e. g., about vaccine adverse events, VAE) affects risk perceptions and intentions. The authors compare the effect of narrative and statistical information about VAE on vaccination decisions and examine if a disclaimer reduces the narrative bias as well as if low numeracy leads to increased use of the narratives. Method and Design. In an online experiment, 458 participants were randomly assigned to a 3 (relative frequency of vaccine adverse events in 1, 7, or 17 of 20 cases) x 3 (type of information: narratives, summary statistics, or both) x 2 (bias awareness v. control disclaimer) between-subjects design. Measurements. Perceived risk, vaccination intention, and subjective numeracy. Results. A higher relative frequency of cases reporting VAE decreased the intention to get vaccinated. This relation was mediated by increased risk perception. The type of information moderated the contents' impact: Summary statistics had the smallest impact, whereas narrative information was more influential, and the presence of both types of information had the greatest impact on risk perception. Individuals who received the bias-awareness disclaimer were less influenced by the patient network. Highly numerate individuals were generally more sensitive to the provided information independent of its format. Conclusions. Patient networks can influence vaccination decisions by delivering risk-related information. Disclaimers may help to reduce the influence if desired.

Support Network Factors Associated With Naming a Health Care Decision-Maker and Talking About Advance Care Planning Among People Living With HIV	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Support network; HIV/AIDS; advance care planning; naming decision-maker; family or informal caregiver; African American or black; palliative care	INJECTION-DRUG USERS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; OF-LIFE; INTERVENTION; SUPPRESSION; DIRECTIVES; ADHERENCE; QUALITY	Context. Little attention has been given to social environmental factors associated with advance care planning (ACP) among African Americans or people living with advanced HIV (PLHIV). Objectives. The present study aimed to identify support network factors that affect the likelihood of naming a decision-maker and of talking to family/friends and doctors about ACP among vulnerable PLHIV. Methods. PLHIV were recruited from a large urban HIV clinic. A social support network inventory was used to calculate number of persons available for various types of support. Characteristics of network members were also collected. Multivariable logistc regression models were fit to examine associations between social network factors and ACP discussion, adjusting for age, sex, education, and total number of network members. Results. The sample (N = 370) was mostly African American (95%), male (56%), and 48% had less than a high school education. Almost half the sample (48%) had talked to their family/friends or doctor about ACP, and 34% had named a medical decision-maker. Adjusted analysis revealed that talking about ACP with family/friends was associated with female sex and a larger closer support network who provided health information and physical assistance. Talking to doctors about ACP was associated with larger support networks who provided physical assistance but lower numbers from whom emotional support was received. Naming a decision-maker was associated with greater numbers of network members who provided emotional support, health information, and medication adherence reminders. Conclusion. The findings revealed aspects of family/support network structures and caregiving function associated with ACP in a population with often vital yet vulnerable networks.

Public Reactions to the Cigarette Control Regulation on a Chinese Microblogging Platform: Empirical Analysis	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						cigarette smoking; regulations; social media; information networks	ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES; NETWORK ANALYSIS; HEALTH; TWITTER; SMOKERS	Background: On January 1, 2019, a new regulation on the control of smoking in public places was officially implemented in Hangzhou, China On the day of the implementation, a large number of Chinese media reported the contents of the regulation on the microblog platform Weibo, causing a strong response from and heated discussion among netizens. Objective: This study aimed to conduct a content and network analysis to examine topics and patterns in the social media response to the new regulation. Methods: We analyzed all microblogs on Weibo that mentioned and explained the regulation in the first 8 days following the implementation. We conducted a content analysis on these microblogs and used social network visualization and descriptive statistics to identify key users and key microblogs. Results: Of 7924 microblogs, 12.85% (1018/7924) were in support of the smoking control regulation, 84.12% (6666/7924) were neutral, and 1.31% (104/7924) were opposed to the smoking regulation control. For the negative posts, the public had doubts about the intentions of the policy, its implementation, and the regulations on electronic cigarettes. In addition, 1.72% (136/7924) were irrelevant to the smoking regulation control. Among the 1043 users who explicitly expressed their positive or negative attitude toward the policy, a large proportion of users showed supportive attitudes (956/1043, 91.66%). A total of 5 topics and 11 subtopics were identified. Conclusions: This study used a content and network analysis to examine topics and patterns in the social media response to the new smoking regulation. We found that the number of posts with a positive attitude toward the regulation was considerably higher than that of the posts with a negative attitude toward the regulation. Our findings may assist public health policy makers to better understand the policy's intentions, scope, and potential effects on public interest and support evidence-based public health regulations in the future.

J	Bergman, BG; Wu, WY; Marsch, LA; Crosier, BS; DeLise, TC; Hassanpour, S				Bergman, Brandon G.; Wu, Weiyi; Marsch, Lisa A.; Crosier, Benjamin S.; DeLise, Timothy C.; Hassanpour, Saeed			Associations Between Substance Use and Instagram Participation to Inform Social Network-Based Screening Models: Multimodal Cross-Sectional Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						substance use; social network sites; health risk; screening; machine learning; social media; Instagram; alcohol; drug	NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDERS; GLOBAL BURDEN; DRUG-USE; DISEASE	Background: Technology-based computational strategies that leverage social network site (SNS) data to detect substance use are promising screening tools but rely on the presence of sufficient data to detect risk if it is present. A better understanding of the association between substance use and SNS participation may inform the utility of these technology-based screening tools. Objective: This paper aims to examine associations between substance use and Instagram posts and to test whether such associations differ as a function of age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Methods: Participants with an Instagram account were recruited primarily via Clickworker (N=3117). With participant permission and Instagram's approval, participants' Instagram photo posts were downloaded with an application program interface. Participants' past-year substance use was measured with an adapted version of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Quick Screen. At-risk drinking was defined as at least one past-year instance having "had more than a few alcoholic drinks a day," drug use was defined as any use of nonprescription drugs, and prescription drug use was defined as any nonmedical use of prescription medications. We used logistic regression to examine the associations between substance use and any Instagram posts and negative binomial regression to examine the associations between substance use and number of Instagram posts. We examined whether age (18-25, 26-38, 39+ years), gender, and race/ethnicity moderated associations in both logistic and negative binomial models. All differences noted were significant at the .05 level. Results: Compared with no at-risk drinking, any at-risk drinking was associated with both a higher likelihood of any Instagram posts and a higher number of posts, except among Hispanic/Latino individuals, in whom at-risk drinking was associated with a similar number of posts. Compared with no drug use, any drug use was associated with a higher likelihood of any posts but was associated with a similar number of posts. Compared with no prescription drug use, any prescription drug use was associated with a similar likelihood of any posts and was associated with a lower number of posts only among those aged 39 years and older. Of note, main effects showed that being female compared with being male and being Hispanic/Latino compared with being White were significantly associated with both a greater likelihood of any posts and a greater number of posts. Conclusions: Researchers developing computational substance use risk detection models using Instagram or other SNS data may wish to consider our findings showing that at-risk drinking and drug use were positively associated with Instagram participation, while prescription drug use was negatively associated with Instagram participation for middle- and older-aged adults. As more is learned about SNS behaviors among those who use substances, researchers may be better positioned to successfully design and interpret innovative risk detection approaches.

Web-based portals may facilitate this shift, but little is known about how such tools are used or the role they may play in personal recovery. Objective: The aim was to illustrate uses and experiences with the secure e-recovery portal "ReConnect" as an adjunct to ongoing community mental health care and explore its potential role in shifting practices toward recovery. Methods: ReConnect was introduced into two Norwegian mental health care communities and used for 6 months. The aim was to support personal recovery and collaboration between service users and health care providers. Among inclusion criteria for participation were long-term care needs and at least one provider willing to interact with service users through ReConnect. The portal was designed to support ongoing collaboration as each service user-provider dyad/team found appropriate and consisted of (1) a toolbox of resources for articulating and working with recovery processes, such as status/goals/activities relative to life domains (eg, employment, social network, health), medications, network map, and exercises (eg, sleep hygiene, mindfulness); (2) messaging with providers who had partial access to toolbox content; and (3) a peer support forum. Quantitative data (ie, system log, questionnaires) were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data (eg, focus groups, forum postings) are presented relative to four recovery- oriented practice domains: personally defined recovery, promoting citizenship, working relationships, and organizational commitment. Results: Fifty-six participants (29 service users and 27 providers) made up 29 service user-provider dyads. Service users reported having 11 different mental health diagnoses, with a median 2 (range 1-7) diagnoses each. The 27 providers represented nine different professional backgrounds. The forum was the most frequently used module with 1870 visits and 542 postings. Service users' control over toolbox resources (eg, defining and working toward personal goals), coupled with peer support, activated service users in their personal recovery processes and in community engagement. Some providers (30%, 8/27) did not interact with service users through ReConnect. Dyads that used the portal resources did so in highly diverse ways, and participants reported needing more than 6 months to discover and adapt optimal uses relative to their individual and collaborative needs. Conclusions: Regardless of providers' portal use, service users' control over toolbox resources, coupled with peer support, offered an empowering common frame of reference that represented a shift toward recovery- oriented practices within communities. Although service users' autonomous use of the portal can eventually influence providers in the direction of recovery practices, a fundamental shift is unlikely without broader organizational commitments aligned with recovery principles (eg, quantified goals for service user involvement in care plans).

J	Gopalsamy, R; Semenov, A; Pasiliao, E; McIntosh, S; Nikolaev, A				Gopalsamy, Rahul; Semenov, Alexander; Pasiliao, Eduardo; McIntosh, Scott; Nikolaev, Alexander			Engagement as a Driver of Growth of Online Health Forums: Observational Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						online health forum; online health community; engagement; engagement capacity; superuser; eHealth; social network analysis	SOCIAL NETWORKS; PROMOTION	Background: The emerging research on nurturing the growth of online communities posits that it is in part attributed to network effects, wherein every increase in the volume of user-generated content increases the value of the community in the eyes of its potential new members. The recently introduced metric engagement capacity offers a means of quantitatively assessing the ability of online platform users to engage each other into generating content; meanwhile, the quantity engagement value is useful for quantifying communication-based platform use. If the claim that higher engagement leads to accelerated growth holds true for online health forums (OHFs), then engagement tracking should become an important tool in the arsenal of OHF managers. Indeed, it might allow for quantifying the ability of an OHF to exploit network effects, thus predicting the OHF's future success. Objective: This study aimed to empirically analyze the relationship between internal OHF use (quantified using engagement measurement), and external growth. Methods: We collected data from 7 OHFs posted between the years 1999 and 2016. Longitudinal analyses were conducted by evaluating engagement in the OHFs over time. We analyzed 2-way causality effects between the engagement value and metrics evaluating OHF growth using Granger causality tests. User activity metrics per week were correlated with engagement metrics, followed by linear regression analyses. Results: Observational data showed a 1-way causal relationship between the OHF engagement value and reach (P=. 02). We detected a 2-way causal relationship between the engagement value and delurking, with further analysis indicating that the engagement value was more likely to cause delurking (P<. 001 with lag 2; for the reverse hypothesis, P=. 01 with lag 2). Users who engaged each other more were more likely (up to 14 times, depending on how much one user engaged another) to develop personal connections. Finally, we found that the more engaging an OHF user was in a given week, the more likely (up to 2 times, depending on their ability to engage others) they were to remain active in the OHF in the following week. Conclusions: This study supports the claim that network effects play an important role in accelerating OHF growth, opening the door to exploiting these effects in calculated ways. In such efforts, engagement metrics can be used to monitor the "health" of an OHF and to identify the users most important to its success.

J	Stahmer, AC; Suhrheinrich, J; Schetter, PL; Hassrick, EM				Stahmer, Aubyn C.; Suhrheinrich, Jessica; Schetter, Patricia L.; Hassrick, Elizabeth McGee			Exploring multi-level system factors facilitating educator training and implementation of evidence-based practices (EBP): a study protocol	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Multi-level system factors; Special education; Autism; Evidence-based practices; Implementation; Teacher training	COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT MODELS; MENTAL-HEALTH; YOUNG-ADULTS; DECISION-MAKING; AUTISM; CHILDREN; VALIDITY; INTERVENTION; CONSULTATION; EMPLOYMENT	Background: This study examines how system-wide (i.e., region, district, and school) mechanisms such as leadership support, training requirements, structure, collaboration, and education affect the use of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in schools and how this affects the outcomes for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite growing evidence for the positive effects of EBPs for ASD, these practices are not consistently or effectively used in schools. Although special education programs are mandated to use EBPs, there are very few evidence-based methods for selecting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs. Research focuses primarily on teacher training, without attention to contextual factors (e.g., implementation climate, attitudes toward EBPs, resource allocation, and social networks) that may impact outcomes. Using an implementation science framework, this project will prospectively examine relations between system-wide factors and teachers' use of EBPs and student education outcomes. Methods/design: Survey data will be collected from approximately 85 regional special education directors, 170 regional program specialists, 265 district special education directors, 265 behavior specialists, 925 school principals, 3538 special education teachers, and 2700 paraprofessionals. Administrative data for the students with ASD served by participating teachers will be examined. A total of 79 regional-, district-, and school-level personnel will also participate in social network interviews. Mixed methods, including surveys, administrative data, and observational checklists, will be used to gather in-depth information about system-wide malleable factors that relate to positive teacher implementation of EBPs and student outcomes. Multi-level modeling will be used to assess system-wide malleable factors related to EBP implementation which will be linked to the trainer, teacher, and student outcomes and examined based on moderators (e.g., district size, Special Education Local Plan Area structure, teachers' ASD experience). Finally, a dynamic social network approach will be used to map EBP-related connectivity across all levels of the system for selected regions. Dynamic network analysis will be used to gauge the degree to which and ways that EBP trainings, resources, and interventions are shared (or not shared) among school staff. Discussion: Results are expected to inform the development of system-wide interventions to improve the school-based implementation of EBPs for students with ASD.

The aim of the study was to explore the need for assistance in daily activities among older Slovenian people living at home. Older adults aged between 65 and 97 years (N = 358) participated in the cross-sectional survey study. A questionnaire that assessed independence in daily activities and assistance in the home environment was developed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a nonparametric test (Wilcoxon signed rank test), and the chi-square test. The results showed that older Slovenians were more independent in activities of daily living (ADLs) than instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Independence was the highest for using the toilet, feeding, and mobility transfers, and the lowest for bathing. With IADLs, assistance was most often required with shopping and housework; this assistance was usually provided by family members. The provider of assistance was generally compatible with older people's preferences concerning assistance at home. We found no differences in care preferences between urban and rural settings. Assistance in the home environment was predominantly provided by unpaid helpers, which reflects recent developments in health and social services that put an emphasis on a person's social network. Due to demographic changes and the decrease in the number of adult children, reliance on close relatives might soon become a challenge. These findings can help policy makers understand older people's choices and preferences better when planning long-term care.

Charting the Publication and Citation Impact of the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program From 2006 Through 2016	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION; HEALTH	Purpose The authors evaluated publication and citation patterns for articles supported by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) hub investment over the first decade of the CTSA program. The aim was to elucidate a pivotal step in the translational process by providing an account of how time, hub maturity, and hub attributes were related to productivity and influence in the academic literature. Method In 2017, the authors collected bibliometric data from PubMed, Web of Science InCites, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) iCite for articles citing any CTSA hub grants published from hub inception through 2016. They compiled data on publication and citation rates and indices of relative citation impact aggregated by hub funding year cohort. They compared hub-level bibliometric activity by multi- versus single-institution structure and total monetary award sums, compiled from NIH RePORTER. Results From 2006-2016, CTSA hubs supported over 66,000 publications, with publication rates accelerating as hubs matured. These publications accumulated over 1.2 million citations, with some articles cited over 1,000 times. Indices of relative citation impact indicated CTSA-supported publications were cited more than twice as often as expected for articles of their publication years and disciplines. Multi-institutional hubs and those awarded higher grant sums exhibited significantly higher publication and citation activity. Conclusions The CTSA program is yielding a robust and growing body of influential research findings with consistently high indices of relative citation impact. Preliminary evidence suggests multi-institutional collaborations and more monetary resources are associated with elevated bibliometric activity and, therefore, may be worth their investment.

Brain Tumor Discussions on Twitter (#BTSM): Social Network Analysis	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						brain tumors; social media; health care; patient support; network analysis		Background: The Brain Tumor Social Media (#BTSM) Twitter hashtag was founded in February 2012 as a disease-specific hashtag for patients with brain tumor. Objective: To understand #BTSM's role as a patient support system, we describe user descriptors, growth, interaction, and content sharing. Methods: We analyzed all tweets containing #BTSM from 2012 to 2018 using the Symplur Signals platform to obtain data and to describe Symplur-defined user categories, tweet content, and trends in use over time. We created a network plot with all publicly available retweets involving #BTSM in 2018 to visualize key stakeholders and their connections to other users. Results: From 2012 to 2018, 59,764 unique users participated in #BTSM, amassing 298,904 tweets. The yearly volume of #BTSM tweets increased by 264.57% from 16,394 in 2012 to 43,373 in 2018 with #BTSM constantly trending in the top 15 list of disease hashtags, as well the top 15 list of tweet chats. Patient advocates generated the most #BTSM tweets (33.13%), while advocacy groups, caregivers, doctors, and researchers generated 7.01%, 4.63%, 3.86%, and 3.37%, respectively. Physician use, although still low, has increased over time. The 2018 network plot of retweets including #BTSM identifies a number of key stakeholders from the patient advocate, patient organization, and medical researcher domains and reveals the extent of their reach to other users. Conclusions: From its start in 2012, #BTSM has grown exponentially over time. We believe its growth suggests its potential as a global source of brain tumor information on Twitter for patients, advocates, patient organizations as well as health care professionals and researchers.

J	Siu, JYM				Siu, Judy Yuen-man			Coping with future epidemics: Tai chi practice as an overcoming strategy used by survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in post-SARS Hong Kong	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						Hong Kong; overcoming strategy; post-SARS; SARS survivors; Tai chi	ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; COMPLEMENTARY; EXPERIENCE; PATIENT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BIOMEDICINE; ATTITUDES; THERAPY; PEOPLE; ADULTS	BackgroundAlthough SARS had been with a controversial topic for a decade at the time of this study, numerous SARS survivors had not yet physically, psychologically or socially recovered from the aftermath of SARS. Among chronically ill patients, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is reported to be widespread. However, extremely little is known about the use of CAM by SARS survivors in the post-SARS period and even less is known about how the use of CAM is related to the unpleasant social and medical-treatment experiences of SARS survivors, their eagerness to re-establish social networks, and their awareness to prepare for future epidemics. ObjectiveTo investigate the motivations for practising tai chi among SARS survivors in post-SARS Hong Kong. Design, setting and participantsUsing a qualitative approach, I conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 35 SARS survivors, who were purposively sampled from a tai chi class of a SARS-patient self-help group in Hong Kong. ResultsHealth concerns and social experiences motivated the participants to practise tai chi in post-SARS Hong Kong. Experiencing health deterioration in relation to SARS-associated sequelae, coping with unpleasant experiences during follow-up biomedical treatments, a desire to regain an active role in recovery and rehabilitation, overcoming SARS-associated stigmas by establishing a new social network and preparing for potential future stigmatization and discrimination were the key motivators for them. ConclusionThe participants practised tai chi not only because they sought to improve their health but also because it provided a crucial social function and meaning to them.

The support systems of expecting families can include many elements, such as family members, friends, and work or community groups. Emerging health information technologies (eg, social media, internet websites, and mobile apps) provide new resources for pregnant families to augment their support systems and to fill information gaps. Objective: This study sought to determine the number and nature of the components of the support systems of pregnant women and their caregivers (eg, family members) and the role of health information technologies in these support systems. We examined the differences between pregnant women's support systems and those of their caregivers and the associations between support system composition and stress levels. Methods: We enrolled pregnant women and caregivers from advanced maternal-fetal and group prenatal care clinics. Participants completed surveys assessing sociodemographic characteristics, health literacy, numeracy, and stress levels and were asked to draw a picture of their support system. Support system elements were extracted from drawings, categorized by type (ie, individual persons, groups, technologies, and other) and summarized for pregnant women and caregivers. Participant characteristics and support system elements were compared using the Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon ranked sum test for continuous variables. Associations between support system characteristics and stress levels were measured with Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: The study enrolled 100 participants: 71 pregnant women and 29 caregivers. The support systems of pregnant women were significantly larger than those of caregivers-an average of 7.4 components for pregnant women and 5.4 components for caregivers (P=.003). For all participants, the most commonly reported support system elements were individual persons (408/680, 60.0%), followed by people groups (132/680, 19.4%), technologies (112/680, 16.5%), and other resources (28/680, 4.1%). Pregnant women's and caregivers' technology preferences within their support systems differed-pregnant women more often identified informational websites, apps, and social media as parts of their support systems, whereas caregivers more frequently reported general internet search engines. The size and components of these support systems were not associated with levels of stress. Conclusions: This study is one of the first demonstrating that technologies comprise a substantial portion of the support systems of pregnant women and their caregivers. Pregnant women more frequently reported specific medical information websites as part of their support system, whereas caregivers more often reported general internet search engines. Although social support is important for maternal and fetal health outcomes, no associations among stress, support system size, and support system components were found in this study. As health information technologies continue to evolve and their adoption increases, their role in patient and caregiver support systems and their effects should be further explored.

The aim of this paper is to describe how within a programme of research and implementation, social networks are viewed as being centrally involved in the mobilisation and deployment of resources in the management of a chronic condition. This forms the basis of a novel approach to understanding, designing, and implementing new forms of self-management support. Methods: Drawing on evidence syntheses about social networks and capital and the role of information in self-management, we build on four conceptual approaches to inform the design of our research on the implementation of self-care support for people with long-term conditions. Our approach takes into consideration the form and content of social networks, notions of chronic illness work, normalisation process theory (NPT), and the whole systems informing self-management engagement (WISE) approach to self-care support. Discussion: The translation and implementation of a self-care agenda in contemporary health and social context needs to acknowledge and incorporate the resources and networks operating in patients' domestic and social environments and everyday lives. The latter compliments the focus on healthcare settings for developing and delivering self-care support by viewing communities and networks, as well as people suffering from long-term conditions, as a key means of support for managing long-term conditions. By focusing on patient work and social-network provision, our aim is to open up a second frontier in implementation research, to translate knowledge into better chronic illness management, and to shift the emphasis towards support that takes place outside formal health services.

J	Ha, D; Song, I; Park, S; Lee, EK				Ha, Dongmun; Song, Inmyung; Park, Sunyoung; Lee, Eui-Kyung			Factors Associated With the Management of Adverse Drug Reactions Among Community Pharmacists in South Korea	JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY			English	Article						drugs safety; ADR prevention; pharmacists' perception; pharmacists' practice	HOSPITAL PHARMACISTS; ATTITUDES; KNOWLEDGE; PHARMACOVIGILANCE; PERCEPTIONS	Objectives Community pharmacists dispensed 68.4% of all drugs used in Korea, but reported only 2.0% of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 2011. This study compared community pharmacists' understanding of the importance of ADR management and their actual practice of it, and identified relevant factors related to their management of ADR. Methods With the use of a modified health belief model (HBM), 800 community pharmacists were surveyed via social network service messaging. A total of 200 usable responses were obtained for an effective response rate of 25.0%. Descriptive analysis was used to quantify the differences between community pharmacists' understanding of the importance of ADR prevention and their practice. A hierarchical regression was performed with the following predictors: (1) demographic factors, (2) social impact of ADR prevention, (3) importance of social support, and (4) cognition about the importance of ADR prevention. Results Although community pharmacists clearly recognized the importance of ADR management, their performance was very low. The disparity between cognition and performance was more pronounced for ADR reporting than for patient counseling. Social support was the most powerful predictor of ADR prevention practice, explaining 18.5% of the variance in ADR prevention practice. Social impact of ADR prevention, demographic factors, and cognition about the importance of ADR prevention explained 12.6%, 6.2%, and 1.8% of the variance, respectively. Conclusions Strengthening community pharmacists' performance of population-based ADR management should be prioritized over patient-oriented ADR management. To improve public health, community pharmacists should make an effort at ADR reporting. This can be done with appropriate government support, such as incentives to community pharmacists, public awareness campaigns, education, and establishment of feedback systems.

J	Myneni, S; Cobb, N; Cohen, T				Myneni, Sahiti; Cobb, Nathan; Cohen, Trevor			In Pursuit of Theoretical Ground in Behavior Change Support Systems: Analysis of Peer-to-Peer Communication in a Health-Related Online Community	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						behavior change; online social media; web interventions; smoking cessation	SMOKING-CESSATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; SELF-EFFICACY; BREAST-CANCER; INTERVENTION; PEOPLE; TEXT; INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS; QUALITY	Background: Research studies involving health-related online communities have focused on examining network structure to understand mechanisms underlying behavior change. Content analysis of the messages exchanged in these communities has been limited to the "social support" perspective. However, existing behavior change theories suggest that message content plays a prominent role reflecting several sociocognitive factors that affect an individual's efforts to make a lifestyle change. An understanding of these factors is imperative to identify and harness the mechanisms of behavior change in the Health 2.0 era. Objective: The objective of this work is two-fold: (1) to harness digital communication data to capture essential meaning of communication and factors affecting a desired behavior change, and (2) to understand the applicability of existing behavior change theories to characterize peer-to-peer communication in online platforms. Methods: In this paper, we describe grounded theory-based qualitative analysis of digital communication in QuitNet, an online community promoting smoking cessation. A database of 16,492 de-identified public messages from 1456 users from March 1-April 30, 2007, was used in our study. We analyzed 795 messages using grounded theory techniques to ensure thematic saturation. This analysis enabled identification of key concepts contained in the messages exchanged by QuitNet members, allowing us to understand the sociobehavioral intricacies underlying an individual's efforts to cease smoking in a group setting. We further ascertained the relevance of the identified themes to theoretical constructs in existing behavior change theories (eg, Health Belief Model) and theoretically linked techniques of behavior change taxonomy. Results: We identified 43 different concepts, which were then grouped under 12 themes based on analysis of 795 messages. Examples of concepts include "sleepiness," "pledge," "patch," "spouse," and "slip." Examples of themes include "traditions," "social support," "obstacles," "relapse," and "cravings." Results indicate that themes consisting of member-generated strategies such as "virtual bonfires" and "pledges" were related to the highest number of theoretical constructs from the existing behavior change theories. In addition, results indicate that the member-generated communication content supports sociocognitive constructs from more than one behavior change model, unlike the majority of the existing theory-driven interventions. Conclusions: With the onset of mobile phones and ubiquitous Internet connectivity, online social network data reflect the intricacies of human health behavior as experienced by health consumers in real time. This study offers methodological insights for qualitative investigations that examine the various kinds of behavioral constructs prevalent in the messages exchanged among users of online communities. Theoretically, this study establishes the manifestation of existing behavior change theories in QuitNet-like online health communities. Pragmatically, it sets the stage for real-time, data-driven sociobehavioral interventions promoting healthy lifestyle modifications by allowing us to understand the emergent user needs to sustain a desired behavior change.

J	Lwowski, B; Rios, A				Lwowski, Brandon; Rios, Anthony			The risk of racial bias while tracking influenza-related content on social media using machine learning	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						deep learning; classification; machine learning; social network; fairness	VACCINATION; DISPARITIES; ADULTS; HEALTH	Objective: Machine learning is used to understand and track influenza-related content on social media. Because these systems are used at scale, they have the potential to adversely impact the people they are built to help. In this study, we explore the biases of different machine learning methods for the specific task of detecting influenza-related content. We compare the performance of each model on tweets written in Standard American English (SAE) vs African American English (AAE). Materials and Methods: Two influenza-related datasets are used to train 3 text classification models (support vector machine, convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory) with different feature sets. The datasets match real-world scenarios in which there is a large imbalance between SAE and AAE examples. The number of AAE examples for each class ranges from 2% to 5% in both datasets. We also evaluate each model's performance using a balanced dataset via undersampling. Results: We find that all of the tested machine learning methods are biased on both datasets. The difference in false positive rates between SAE and AAE examples ranges from 0.01 to 0.35. The difference in the false negative rates ranges from 0.01 to 0.23. We also find that the neural network methods generally has more unfair results than the linear support vector machine on the chosen datasets. Conclusions: The models that result in the most unfair predictions may vary from dataset to dataset. Practitioners should be aware of the potential harms related to applying machine learning to health-related social media data. At a minimum, we recommend evaluating fairness along with traditional evaluation metrics.

At Baycrest Health Sciences, a geriatric care centre, pain in its acute care unit had been managed through consultations with the pain team on a case-by-case basis. In an intervention informed by knowledge translation (KT), the pain specialists integrated within the social network of the acute care team for 6months to disseminate their expertise. A survey was administered to staff on the unit before and after the intervention of the pain team to understand staff perceptions of pain management. Pre- and post-comparisons of the survey responses were analysed by using t-tests. This study provided some evidence for the success of this interprofessional education initiative through changes in staff confidence with respect to pain management. It also showed that embedding the pain team into the acute care team supported the KT process as an effective method of interprofessional team building. Incorporating the pain team into the acute care unit to provide training and ongoing decision support was a feasible strategy for KT and could be replicated in other clinical settings.

J	Heijmans, N; van Lieshout, J; Wensing, M				Heijmans, Naomi; van Lieshout, Jan; Wensing, Michel			Social networks of health care providers and patients in cardiovascular risk management: a study protocol	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Social network analysis; Information sharing; Primary care; Cardiovascular disease	BEHAVIOR; DISEASE; SPREAD; PROFESSIONALS; PREVENTION; DEPRESSION; VALIDITY	Background: In recent years, preventive and clinical interventions for cardiovascular risk management have been implemented widely in primary care in the Netherlands. Although this has enhanced quality and outcomes of cardiovascular risk management, further improvement remains possible. In the planned observational study, we aim to examine the role of social networks of healthcare providers and patients in quality and outcomes of cardiovascular risk management. Methods/Design: In a longitudinal observational study, data on social networks of approximately 300 primary care providers from 30 general practices and 900 cardiovascular patients will be collected twice, with a six month interval, using a mix of measures. Social networks are documented with specifically designed questionnaires for patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals. For each included patient, we will extract from medical records to gather data on clinical processes and cardiovascular risk predictors. Data on self-management and psychosocial outcomes of patients will be collected using questionnaires for patients. The analysis focuses on identifying network characteristics, which are associated with (changes in) cardiovascular risk management or self-management.

J	Johansson, M; Bjorne, P; Runesson, I; Ahlstrom, G				Johansson, Maria; Bjorne, Petra; Runesson, Ingrid; Ahlstrom, Gerd			Healthy Ageing in People with Intellectual Disabilities from Managers' Perspective: A Qualitative Study	HEALTHCARE			English	Article						active ageing; content analysis; daily activity centre; group home; healthy ageing; intellectual disability; mental retardation; older people; qualitative interviews; successful ageing	OLDER-PEOPLE; BAD-NEWS; STAFF; GUIDELINES; SERVICES; ADULTS; DEATH	An increasing number of people with intellectual disability (ID) are reaching older ages today although they experience more health problems than the older population without ID. Leaders in intellectual disability services can greatly influence the conditions for a healthy ageing, and the aim of the present study was to explore healthy ageing in this group from the perspective of the leaders. Interviews with 20 leaders were subjected to qualitative content analysis. The findings gave rise to the overall theme ageing in dependence, which emerged from the following six categories: Supporting self-determination; Inaccessible activities after retirement; Signs of decline; Increased and specific needs for support and care; A non-question of gender; Aspects concerning the end of life and death. A prerequisite for healthy ageing in the case of people with ID is, according to the leaders, that they can live the life according to their preferences and make independent choices whilst at the same time receiving adequate support. With the shrinking of their social network after retirement, they become increasingly dependent on staff and leaders in the group home, who need to know what healthy ageing implies.

However, tools that could improve the management of obesity, including self-monitoring, engagement with a social network, and open channels of communication between the patient and doctor, are limited in a clinic-based setting. Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate the usability and acceptability of a newly developed mobile app linked with an accelerometer and its early effects on patient-doctor relationships. Methods: From September 2013 to February 2014, we developed a mobile app linked with an accelerometer as a supportive tool for a clinic-based weight loss program. The app used information from electronic health records and delivered tailored educational material. Personal goal setting, as well as monitoring of weight changes and physical activity combined with feedback, are key features of the app. We also incorporated an interactive message board for patients and doctors. During the period of March 2014 to May 2014, we tested our mobile app for 1 month in participants in a hospital clinic setting. We assessed the app's usability and acceptability, as well as the patient-doctor relationship, via questionnaires and analysis of app usage data. Results: We recruited 30 individuals (18 male and 12 female) for the study. The median number of log-ins per day was 1.21, with the most frequently requested item being setting goals, followed by track physical activities and view personal health status. Scales of the depth of the patient-doctor relationship decreased from 27.6 (SD 4.8) to 25.1 (SD 4.5) by a Wilcoxon signed rank test (P=.02). Conclusions: A mobile phone app linked with an accelerometer for a clinic-based weight loss program is useful and acceptable for weight management but exhibited less favorable early effects on patient-doctor relationships.

There are thousands of YouTube videos promoting misleading information about anorexia (eg, anorexia as a healthy lifestyle). Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate anorexia-related misinformation disseminated through YouTube videos. Methods: We retrieved YouTube videos related to anorexia using the keywords anorexia, anorexia nervosa, proana, and thinspo on October 10, 2011. Three doctors reviewed 140 videos with approximately 11 hours of video content, classifying them as informative, pro-anorexia, or others. By informative we mean content describing the health consequences of anorexia and advice on how to recover from it; by pro-anorexia we mean videos promoting anorexia as a fashion, a source of beauty, and that share tips and methods for becoming and remaining anorexic. The 40 most-viewed videos (20 informative and 20 pro-anorexia videos) were assessed to gauge viewer behavior. Results: The interrater agreement of classification was moderate (Fleiss' kappa=0.5), with 29.3% (n=41) being rated as pro-anorexia, 55.7% (n=78) as informative, and 15.0% (n=21) as others. Pro-anorexia videos were favored 3 times more than informative videos (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% CI 3.3-3.4, P<.001). Conclusions: Pro-anorexia information was identified in 29.3% of anorexia-related videos. Pro-anorexia videos are less common than informative videos; however, in proportional terms, pro-anorexia content is more highly favored and rated by its viewers. Efforts should focus on raising awareness, particularly among teenagers, about the trustworthiness of online information about beauty and healthy lifestyles. Health authorities producing videos to combat anorexia should consider involving celebrities and models to reach a wider audience. More research is needed to study the characteristics of pro-anorexia videos in order to develop algorithms that will automatically detect and filter those videos before they become popular.

The Importance of "Being There": a Qualitative Study of What Veterans with Depression Want in Social Support	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						social support; military veterans; suicide prevention; major depressive disorder	MASS-MEDIA CAMPAIGNS; HEALTH-SERVICE USE; SUICIDAL IDEATION; HELP-SEEKING; INVOLVEMENT; OUTCOMES; NETWORK; FAMILY; CARE; INTERVENTION	Background Social connectedness exerts strong influences on health, including major depression and suicide. A major component of social connectedness is having individual relationships with close supports, romantic partners, and other trusted members of one's social network. Objective The objective of this study was to understand how individuals' relationships with close supports might be leveraged to improve outcomes for primary care patients with depression and at risk for suicide. Design In this qualitative study, we used a semi-structured interview guide to probe patient experiences, views, and preferences related to social support. Participants We conducted interviews with 30 primary care patients at a Veterans Health Administration (VA) medical center who had symptoms of major depression and a close support. Approach Thematic analysis of qualitative interview data examined close supports' impact on patients. We iteratively developed a codebook, used output from codes to sort data into themes, and selected quotations that exemplified themes for inclusion in this manuscript. Key Results "Being there" as an important quality of close supports emerged as a key concept. "Being there" was defined in three ways: physical proximity, frequent or responsive contact, or perceived availability. Close supports who were effective at "being there" possessed skills in intuitively sensing the patient's emotional state and communicating indirectly about depression. Three major barriers to involving close supports in depression care were concerns of overburdening the close support, a perception that awareness of the patient's depression would make the close support unnecessarily worried, and a desire and preference among patients to handle depression on their own. Conclusions "Being there" represents a novel, patient-generated way to conceptualize and talk about social support. Suicide prevention initiatives such as population-level communication campaigns might be improved by incorporating language used by patients and addressing attitudinal barriers to allowing help and involvement of close supports.

BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						IYCF; Nutrition; Formative research; Mobile phone; Bangladesh	FEEDING PRACTICES; INFANT; INTERVENTIONS; IMPACT	Background: Nutrition has been integrated within the health services in Bangladesh as it is an important issue for health and development. High penetration of mobile phones in the community and favourable policy and political commitment of the Government of Bangladesh has created possibilities of using Information Communication Technology such as mobile phones for nutrition programs. In this paper the implementation of nutrition services with a specific focus on infant and young child feeding was explored and the potential for using mobile phones to improve the quality and coverage of nutrition services was assessed. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in Mirzapur and Chakaria sub-districts, Bangladesh from February-April 2014. We conducted 24 in-depth interviews (mothers of young children), 8 focus group discussions (fathers and grandmothers); and 13 key informant interviews (community health workers or CHWs). We also observed 4 facilities and followed 2 CHWs during their work day. The data was analyzed manually using pre-existing themes. Results: In this community, mothers demonstrated gaps in knowledge about IYCF. They depended on their social network and media for IYCF information. Although CHWs were trusted in the community, mothers and their family members did not consider them a good source of nutrition information as they did not talk about nutrition. In terms of ICTs, mobile phones were the most available and used by both CHWs and mothers. CHWs showed willingness to incorporate nutrition counselling through mobile phone as this can enhance their productivity, reduce travel time and improve service quality. Mothers were willing to receive voice calls from CHWs as long as the decision makers in the households were informed. Conclusions: Our study indicated that there are gaps in IYCF related service delivery and there is a potential for using mobile phones to both strengthen the quality of service delivery as well as reaching out to the mothers in the community. It is important however, to consider the community readiness to accept the technology during the design and delivery of the intervention.

J	Plumb, J; Travaglia, J; Nugus, P; Braithwaite, J				Plumb, Jennifer; Travaglia, Joanne; Nugus, Peter; Braithwaite, Jeffrey			Professional conceptualisation and accomplishment of patient safety in mental healthcare: an ethnographic approach	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article								Background: This study seeks to broaden current understandings of what patient safety means in mental healthcare and how it is accomplished. We propose a qualitative observational study of how safety is produced or not produced in the complex context of everyday professional mental health practice. Such an approach intentionally contrasts with much patient safety research which assumes that safety is achieved and improved through top-down policy directives. We seek instead to understand and articulate the connections and dynamic interactions between people, materials, and organisational, legal, moral, professional and historical safety imperatives as they come together at particular times and places to perform safe or unsafe practice. As such we advocate an understanding of patient safety 'from the ground up'. Methods/Design: The proposed project employs a six-phase data collection framework in two mental health settings: an inpatient unit and a community team. The first four phases comprise multiple modes of focussed, unobtrusive observation of professionals at work, to enable us to trace the conceptualisation and enactment of safety as revealed in dialogue and narrative, use of artefacts and space, bodily activity and patterns of movement, and in the accomplishment of specific work tasks. An interview phase and a social network analysis phase will subsequently be conducted to offer comparative perspectives on the observational data. This multi-modal and holistic approach to studying patient safety will complement existing research, which is dominated by instrumentalist approaches to discovering factors contributing to error, or developing interventions to prevent or manage adverse events. Discussion: This ethnographic research framework, informed by the principles of practice theories and in particular actor-network ideas, provides a tool to aid the understanding of patient safety in mental healthcare. The approach is novel in that it seeks to articulate an 'anatomy of patient safety' as it actually occurs, in terms of the networks of elements coalescing to enable the conceptual and material performance of safety in mental health settings. By looking at how patient safety happens or does not happen, this study will enable us to better understand how we might in future productively tackle its improvement.

Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is "sold" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80- and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. Contacting family is likely to be the best "selling point" of the Internet for older people.

The trait or state of mindfulness is significantly related to several indicators of psychological health, and mindfulness-based therapies are effective at preventing and treating many chronic diseases. Interest in mobile applications for health promotion and disease self-management is also growing. Despite the explosion of interest, research on both the design and potential uses of mindfulness-based mobile applications (MBMAs) is scarce. Objective: Our main objective was to study the features and functionalities of current MBMAs and compare them to current evidence-based literature in the health and clinical setting. Methods: We searched online vendor markets, scientific journal databases, and grey literature related to MBMAs. We included mobile applications that featured a mindfulness-based component related to training or daily practice of mindfulness techniques. We excluded opinion-based articles from the literature. Results: The literature search resulted in 11 eligible matches, two of which completely met our selection criteria-a pilot study designed to evaluate the feasibility of a MBMA to train the practice of "walking meditation," and an exploratory study of an application consisting of mood reporting scales and mindfulness-based mobile therapies. The online market search eventually analyzed 50 available MBMAs. Of these, 8% (4/50) did not work, thus we only gathered information about language, downloads, or prices. The most common operating system was Android. Of the analyzed apps, 30% (15/50) have both a free and paid version. MBMAs were devoted to daily meditation practice (27/46, 59%), mindfulness training (6/46, 13%), assessments or tests (5/46, 11%), attention focus (4/46, 9%), and mixed objectives (4/46, 9%). We found 108 different resources, of which the most used were reminders, alarms, or bells (21/108, 19.4%), statistics tools (17/108, 15.7%), audio tracks (15/108, 13.9%), and educational texts (11/108, 10.2%). Daily, weekly, monthly statistics, or reports were provided by 37% (17/46) of the apps. 28% (13/46) of them permitted access to a social network. No information about sensors was available. The analyzed applications seemed not to use any external sensor. English was the only language of 78% (39/50) of the apps, and only 8% (4/50) provided information in Spanish. 20% (9/46) of the apps have interfaces that are difficult to use. No specific apps exist for professionals or, at least, for both profiles (users and professionals). We did not find any evaluations of health outcomes resulting from the use of MBMAs. Conclusions: While a wide selection of MBMAs seem to be available to interested people, this study still shows an almost complete lack of evidence supporting the usefulness of those applications. We found no randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of these applications on mindfulness training or health indicators, and the potential for mobile mindfulness applications remains largely unexplored.

Various statistical techniques and bibliometric measures were employed, including publication growth analysis; journal distribution; and collaboration network analysis at the author, institution, and country collaboration level. The temporal visualization map of burst terms was drawn, and the co-occurrence matrix of these burst terms was analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis and social network analysis. Results: A total of 2704 bibliographic records on mHealth were collected. The earliest paper centered on mHealth was published in 1997, with the number of papers rising continuously since then. A total of 21.28% (2318/10,895) of authors publishing mHealth research were first author, whereas only 1.29% (141/10,895) of authors had published one paper. The total degree of author collaboration was 4.42 (11,958/2704) and there are 266 core authors who have collectively published 53.07% (1435/2704) of the total number of publications, which means that the core group of authors has fundamentally been formed based on the Law of Price. The University of Michigan published the highest number of mHealth-related publications, but less collaboration among institutions exits. The United States is the most productive country in the field and plays a leading role in collaborative research on mHealth. There are 5543 different identified keywords in the cleaned records. The temporal bar graph clearly presents overall topic evolutionary process over time. There are 12 important research directions identified, which are in the imbalanced development. Moreover, the density of the network was 0.007, a relatively low level. These 12 topics can be categorized into 4 areas: (1) patient engagement and patient intervention, (2) health monitoring and self-care, (3) mobile device and mobile computing, and (4) security and privacy. Conclusions: The collaboration of core authors on mHealth research is not tight and stable. Furthermore, collaboration between institutions mainly occurs in the United States, although country collaboration is seen as relatively scarce. The focus of research topics on mHealth is decentralized. Our study might provide a potential guide for future research in mHealth.

Design and evaluation of a social-based solution for patient support	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						eHealth; Social network; Design; Evaluation; Community; Chronic diseases	USER-CENTERED DESIGN; ONLINE; COMMUNITIES; SENSE; WELL	Objective: To contribute the design, development, and assessment of a new concept: Micro ad hoc Health Social Networks (uHSN), to create a social-based solution for supporting patients with chronic disease. Design: After in-depth fieldwork and intensive co-design over a 4-year project following Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), this paper contributes a new paradigm of uHSN, defining two interaction areas (the "backstage", the sphere invisible to the final user, where processes that build services take place; and the "onstage", the visible part that includes the patients and relatives), and describes a new transversal concept, i.e., "network spaces segments," to provide timely interaction among all involved profiles and guaranteeing qualitative relationships. This proposal is applicable to any service design project and to all types of work areas; in the present work, it served as a social-based solution for supporting patients with chronic disease in two real-life health scenarios: a Parkinson disease patient association and a Stroke rehabilitation service in a hospital. These two scenarios included the following main features: thematic (related to the specific disease), private, and secure (only for the patient, relatives, healthcare professional, therapist, carer), with defined specific objectives (around patient support), small size (from tens to hundreds of users), ability to integrate innovative services (e.g., connection to hospital information service or to health sensors), supported by local therapeutic associations, and clustered with preconfigured relationships among users based in network groups. Measurements: Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach for 6 months, the performance of the uHSN was assessed in the two environments: a hospital rehabilitation unit working with Stroke patients, and a Parkinson disease association providing physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychological support, speech therapy, and social services. We describe the proposed methods for evaluating the uHSN quantitatively and qualitatively, and how the scientific community can replicate and/or integrate this contribution in its research. Results: The uHSN overcomes the main limitations of traditional HSNs in the main areas recommended in the literature: privacy, security, transparency, system ecology, Quality of Service (QoS), and technology enhancement. The qualitative and quantitative research demonstrated its viability and replicability in four key points: user acceptance, productivity improvement, QoS enhancement, and fostering of social relations. It also meets the expectation of connecting health and social worlds, supporting distance rehabilitation, improving professionals' efficiency, expanding users' social capital, improving information quality and immediacy, and enhancing perceived peer/social/emotional support. The scientific contributions of the present paper are the first step not only in customizing health solutions that empower patients, their families, and healthcare professionals, but also in transferring this new paradigm to other scientific, professional, and social environments to create new opportunities.

Online communities for people with long-term conditions have the potential to influence health, usage of health care resources, and facilitate illness self-management. Only recently, however, has evidence been reported on how such communities function and evolve, and how they support self-management of long-term conditions in practice. Objective: The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying online self-management support systems by analyzing the structure and dynamics of the networks connecting users who write posts over time. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal network analysis of anonymized data from 2 patients' online communities from the United Kingdom: the Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation (BLF) communities in 2006-2016 and 2012-2016, respectively. Results: The number of users and activity grew steadily over time, reaching 3345 users and 32,780 posts in the Asthma UK community, and 19,837 users and 875,151 posts in the BLF community People who wrote posts in the Asthma UK forum tended to write at an interval of 1-20 days and six months, while those in the BLF community wrote at an interval of two days. In both communities, most pairs of users could reach one another either directly or indirectly through other users. Those who wrote a disproportionally large number of posts (the superusers) represented 1% of the overall population of both Asthma UK and BLF communities and accounted for 32% and 49% of the posts, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the removal of superusers would cause the communities to collapse. Thus, interactions were held together by very few superusers, who posted frequently and regularly, 65% of them at least every 1.7 days in the BLF community and 70% every 3.1 days in the Asthma UK community Their posting activity indirectly facilitated tie formation between other users. Superusers were a constantly available resource, with a mean of 80 and 20 superusers active at any one time in the BLF and Asthma UK communities, respectively. Over time, the more active users became, the more likely they were to reply to other users' posts rather than to write new ones, shifting from a help-seeking to a help-giving role. This might suggest that superusers were more likely to provide than to seek advice. Conclusions: In this study, we uncover key structural properties related to the way users interact and sustain online health communities. Superusers' engagement plays a fundamental sustaining role and deserves research attention. Further studies are needed to explore network determinants of the effectiveness of online engagement concerning health-related outcomes. In resource-constrained health care systems, scaling up online communities may offer a potentially accessible, wide-reaching and cost-effective intervention facilitating greater levels of self-management.

Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. Conclusions: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

Help-seeking behaviour of patients with haematological malignancies treated with autologous stem cell transplantation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE			English	Article						haematological neoplasms; quality of life; help-seeking; psychological; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SUPPORTIVE CARE NEEDS; CANCER-DIAGNOSIS; MEDICAL-CARE; DISTRESS; HEALTH; INTERVENTION; RESILIENCE; MODEL; SCT	Patients with haematological malignancies undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation face a life-threatening illness and stressful treatment. Although many patients report problems, relatively few patients report a need for additional professional care after treatment. We aimed to gain insight into the factors underlying this discrepancy by exploring patients' needs and help-seeking behaviour in relation to their experienced symptoms and problems. A qualitative research design following the grounded theory approach was used. Twenty patients, treated with autologous stem cell transplantation in the past 2 years, participated in an individual semi-structured interview. Factors contributing to patients' help-seeking behaviour were derived from our data and ordered in the following categories: (1) transition from symptoms to problems; (2) preference for dealing with problems themselves and with help from relatives; (3) problem categories and coping strategies; and (4) motives for (not) bringing in professional help. We concluded that the mere presence of a symptom does not lead to help-seeking behaviour: this relationship is modified by patients' personal goals, future perspective and phase of recovery. Patients seem to prefer to deal with problems without professional care. Patients' actual appeal for professional care depends on their coping strategies, social network and knowledge of available care.	[Braamse, A. M. J.; Beekman, A. T.

Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) form a major cause of sickness absence. The purpose of this study was to explore factors which may influence further marginalization among patients with MUPS on long-term sickness absence. Methods. Two focus-group discussions were conducted with a purposive sample of 12 participants, six men and six women, aged 24-59 years. Their average duration of sickness absence was 10.5 months. Participants were invited to share stories about experiences from the process leading to the ongoing sickness absence, with a focus on the causes being medically unexplained. Systematic text condensation was applied for analysis. Inspired by theories of marginalization and coping, the authors searched for knowledge of how patients' positive resources can be mobilized to counteract processes of marginality. Results. Analysis revealed how invisible symptoms and lack of objective findings were perceived as an additional burden to the sickness absence itself. Factors that could counteract further marginalization were a supportive social network, positive coping strategies such as keeping to the daily schedule and physical activity, and positive attention and confidence from professionals. Conclusions. Confidence from both personal and professional contacts is crucial. GPs have an important and appreciated role in this aspect.

More specifically, we will examine what they understand as promoting or impeding dialogue and how this is related to their professional backgrounds. The professionals participated in a project using an open dialogue approach in order to increase the use of inter-agency network meetings with young people suffering from mental health problems. In this explorative case study, empirical data was collected through interviews conducted with two focus groups, the first comprising healthcare professionals and the second professionals from the social and educational sectors. Content analysis was used, where the main category that emerged was dialogue. To illustrate the findings achieved in the focus groups, observations of inter-agency network meetings are included. The findings describe the significance and challenges of listening and authenticity in the professionals' reflections. The healthcare workers expressed worries concerning their capacities for open and transparent dialogues, while the other professionals' emphasized the usefulness of particular techniques. Inter-agency network meetings may be improved if more awareness is placed on the significance of meeting atmosphere, dwelling on specific topics, dealing with silence and understanding how authentic self-disclosure in reflections can promote the personal growth of the participants.

Socio-demographic patient profiles and hospital efficiency: Does patient mix affect a hospital's ability to perform?	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Length of stay (LOS); DRG; Remuneration; Ranking of hospitals	COST VARIATION; RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH-CARE; LEVEL DATA; SURGERY; STAY; CONSEQUENCES; ADJUSTMENT; LENGTH; INCOME	This study investigates whether inclusion of patient profiles impacts on the inferences drawn from measuring performance using patient level data. Performance is in this setting defined by resources used in treating patients in a given diagnose related group where use of resources is approximated by length of stay (LOS). The analysis is based on Danish registry data from 2006. Patient data include registry data on income, employment status and information on whether the patient receives benefits or lives alone. Considerable variation in the socio-demographic characteristics of patients across Danish hospitals was observed, and some patient characteristics were shown to drive the need for longer hospital stays beyond what is captured in DRG scores. Ranking of hospitals based on observed versus expected LOS remained largely unaffected when controlling for patient characteristics, suggesting that variation in LOS across hospitals is mainly driven by other factors than patients' socio-demographic characteristics. Nevertheless, the results of this study indicate that the current Danish remuneration system discriminates hospitals that more often serve older patients and patients with a less developed social network These hospitals tend to have a reduced turnover of patients and their ability to generate revenue is therefore constrained.

Early detection is critical for rapid intervention, which can potentially reduce the escalation of the disorder. Objective: This study used data from social media networks to explore various methods of early detection of MDDs based on machine learning. We performed a thorough analysis of the dataset to characterize the subjects' behavior based on different aspects of their writings: textual spreading, time gap, and time span. Methods: We proposed 2 different approaches based on machine learning singleton and dual. The former uses 1 random forest (RF) classifier with 2 threshold functions, whereas the latter uses 2 independent RF classifiers, one to detect depressed subjects and another to identify nondepressed individuals. In both cases, features are defined from textual, semantic, and writing similarities. Results: The evaluation follows a time-aware approach that rewards early detections and penalizes late detections. The results show how a dual model performs significantly better than the singleton model and is able to improve current state-of-the-art detection models by more than 10%. Conclusions: Given the results, we consider that this study can help in the development of new solutions to deal with the early detection of depression on social networks.

Therefore, studies that aim to extract QOL information from patient narratives are increasingly drawing attention. Also, several studies have noted that web services for patients, such as patient social networking services, may represent promising resources for QOL research. However, it is still unclear whether patient narrative text contains corresponding amounts of QOL information as self reported QOL. This study investigates if medical staff can accurately estimate patient QOL from only patient narrative texts. We analyzed (1) QOL of cancer patients estimated by medical staff from patient autobiographical texts and (2) self reported QOL scores of cancer patients. We compared patients from the following 3 disease groups: (1) gastrointestinal cancer, (2) breast cancer, and (3) lymphoma. The SF-36v2(TM) Health Survey was used to measure patient QOL in both materials, and the QOLs were compared. We found significant differences between self-reported QOL and estimated QOL in breast cancer patients and lymphoma patients, but not in gastrointestinal cancer patients. In particular, the medical staff tended to underestimate physical QOL scores. Medical staff may underestimate several aspects of QOL scores. On the basis of these results, we may be able to achieve more precise QOL estimation from patient narratives.

J	Nies, H				Nies, Henk			Communities as co-producers in integrated care	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED CARE			English	Article						integrated care; community; co-producer; professional		Integrated care has become too much a professionals' concept, in research and theory development, as well as in practice, especially in high-income countries. The current debate on integrated care is dominated by norms and values of professionals, while most of the care is provided by non-professionals. The paradigms of integrated care for people with complex needs need to be reconsidered. It is argued that non-professional care and care by local communities need to be incorporated as a resource and a co-producer of care. It seems fair to assume that the community as such can take a more prominent role in organising and delivering health and long-term care. This implies redefining professional and non-professional responsibilities and boundaries. The boundary between public and private space is losing its significance, as is the distinction between formal and non-formal care. It also requires renegotiating and transforming organisational boundaries. This has consequences for legislation, funding and professional qualifications, as well as for management and governance. It challenges current professional identities as well as identities of service users, their informal carers and citizens. It may also require new types of funding, including non-monetary currencies, time-sharing and social impact bonds. The challenge is that big, that it needs to be addressed at its smallest scale: the citizen in his social network and local community, being co-producer of really integrated care.

Understanding racial/ethnic differences in information and communication technology (ICT) use could inform technology-based interventions in diverse populations. Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate differences in the use of ICT between racial and ethnic groups as well as by English language proficiency. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 246 women who were aged 18 years or older and pregnant or within 1 year of delivery. They were recruited from 4 hospital-based outpatient clinics and completed a self-administered survey. We used multivariate regression analysis to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and ICT (mobile phone/short message service [SMS] text message, Internet, and social network) usage by race/ethnicity and perceived English language proficiency after adjusting for age, income, marital status, and insurance status. Results: In all, 28% (69/246) of participants were Latina, 40% (98/246) were African American, 23% (56/246) were white, and 9% (23/246) from other racial/ethnic groups. Of the Latinas, 84% (58/69) reported limited English language proficiency and 59% (41/69) were uninsured. More than 90% of all participants reported mobile phone use, but more than 25% (65/246) had changed phone numbers 2 or more times in the past year. Compared to white women, African American women were less likely to SMS text message (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.63) and Latinas were less likely to use the Internet to find others with similar concerns (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.73). Women with limited English language proficiency were less likely to use the Internet overall (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09-0.99) or use email (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.63) compared to women with adequate English language proficiency. Conclusions: Mobile phones are widely available for the delivery of health interventions to low-income, racially diverse pregnant and postpartum women, but disparities in Internet use and SMS text messaging exist. Interventions or programs requiring Web-based apps may have lower uptake unless alternatives are available, such as those adapted for limited English proficiency populations.

The first generation of digital interventions, however, is associated with high attrition rates. Social media presents an opportunity to target this issue. A new generation of digital intervention has harnessed the popularity of social media to both promote engagement and foster social connectedness in youth mental health interventions. Despite their potential, little is known about how young people engage with, and experience, social media-based interventions as well as the optimal design, implementation, and management needed to ensure young people with psychosis receive benefit. Objective: This study aimed to explore how young people engage with, and experience, a long-term social media-based mental health intervention designed to address social functioning in individuals with FEP. Methods: This qualitative study was based on 12 interviews with young people who used Horyzons, a long-term social media-based mental health intervention, as part of a previous randomized controlled trial. A semistructured phenomenological interview guide with open-ended questions was used to explore young people's subjective experience of the intervention. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: A total of 4 superordinate themes emerged during the analysis including (1) shared experience as the catalyst for a cocreated social space, (2) the power of peer support, (3) an upbeat environment, and (4) experiences that interrupt being in Horyzons. Conclusions: We found that Horyzon's therapeutic social network fostered a connection and an understanding among young people. It also aided in the creation of an embodied experience that afforded young people with FEP a sense of self-recognition and belonging over the long term. However, although we found that most young people had strong positive experiences of a social connection on Horyzons, we also found that they experienced significant barriers that could substantively interrupt their ability to use the platform. We found that social anxiety, paranoia, internalized stigma, lack of autonomy, and social protocol confusion interfered with young people's usage of the platform. From a design perspective, digital interventions are flexible and thus equipped to begin addressing these implications by providing customizable and personalized treatment options that account for varying levels of social connection and psychological need that could otherwise interrupt young people's usage of social media-based interventions.

Materials and Methods: The FLOW provides a view of patient data and the capacity to enter short notes via personal mobile devices. It was deployed using a "bring-your-own-device"model in 4 pilot units. Social network analysis (SNA) was applied to audit trails in order to visualize usage patterns. A questionnaire was used to describe user experience. Results: Overall, 253 health professionals used The FLOW with their personal mobile devices from October 2013 to March 2015. In pediatric and neonatal intensive care units (ICUs), a median of 26-26.5 notes were entered per user per day. Visual network representation of app entries showed that usage patterns were different between the ICUs. In 127 questionnaires (50%), respondents reported using The FLOW most often to enter notes and for handoffs. The FLOW was perceived as having improved patient care by 57% of respondents, compared to usual care. Most respondents (86%) wished to continue using The FLOW. Discussion: This study shows how a handoff and rounding tool was quickly adopted in pediatric and neonatal ICUs in a hospital setting where patient charts were still paper-based. Originally developed as a tool to support informal documentation using smartphones, it was adapted to local practices and expanded to print sign-out documents and import notes within the medicolegal record with desktop computers. Interestingly, even if not supported by the nursing administrative authorities, the level of use for data entry among nurses and doctors was similar in all units, indicating close collaboration in documentation practices in these ICUs.

An analysis of the quality of information available on the Internet	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Review						Internet; low back pain; quality of information; HONCode; search engine	WEB	Previous surveys showed a poor quality of the web sites providing health information about low back pain. However, the rapid and continuous evolution of the Internet content may question the current validity of those investigations. The present study is aimed to quantitatively assess the quality of the Internet information about low back pain retrieved with the most commonly employed search engines. An Internet search with the keywords "low back pain" has been performed with Google, Yahoo! and Bing (TM) in the English language. The top 30 hits obtained with each search engine were evaluated by five independent raters and averaged following criteria derived from previous works. All search results were categorized as declaring compliant to a quality standard for health information (e. g. HONCode) or not and based on the web site type (Institutional, Free informative, Commercial, News, Social Network, Unknown). The quality of the hits retrieved by the three search engines was extremely similar. The web sites had a clear purpose, were easy to navigate, and mostly lacked in validity and quality of the provided links. The conformity to a quality standard was correlated with a marked greater quality of the web sites in all respects. Institutional web sites had the best validity and ease of use. Free informative web sites had good quality but a markedly lower validity compared to Institutional websites. Commercial web sites provided more biased information. News web sites were well designed and easy to use, but lacked in validity. The average quality of the hits retrieved by the most commonly employed search engines could be defined as satisfactory and favorably comparable with previous investigations. Awareness of the user about checking the quality of the information remains of concern.

Healthcare professionals' perspectives of barriers and facilitators in implementing physical activity programmes delivered to cancer survivors in a shared-care model: a qualitative study	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Exercise; Health plan implementation; Neoplasms; Qualitative research; Rehabilitation; Cancer survivors	FOLLOW-UP CARE; BREAST-CANCER; REHABILITATION PROGRAM; ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; COMPREHENSIVE CARE; EXERCISE; ONCOLOGISTS; PROVIDERS; PATIENT; WOMEN	Background The positive impact of physical activity programmes has been recognised, but the current uptake is low. Authorities believe delivering these programmes in a shared-care model is a future perspective. The present study aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators affecting physical activity programme implementation in a shared-care model delivered with the cooperation of all the types of healthcare professionals involved. Methods Thirty-one individual interviews with primary healthcare professionals (PHPs) and four focus group interviews with 39 secondary healthcare professionals (SHPs) were undertaken. We used Grol and Flottorp's theoretical models to identify barriers and facilitators in six domains: (1) physical activity programmes, (2) patients, (3) healthcare professionals, (4) social setting, (5) organisation and (6) law and governance. Results In the domain of physical activity programmes, those physical activity programmes that were non-tailored to the patients' needs impeded successful implementation. In the domain of healthcare professionals, the knowledge and skills pertaining to physical activity programmes and non-commitment of healthcare professionals impeded implementation. HCPs expressed their concerns about the negative influence of the patient's social network. Most barriers occurred in the domain of organisation. The PHPs and SHPs raised concerns about ineffective collaboration and networks between hospitals. Only the PHPs raised concerns about poor communication, indeterminate roles, and lack of collaboration with SHPs. Insufficient and unclear insurance coverage of physical activity programmes was a barrier in the domain of law and governance. Conclusions Improving the domain of organisation seems the most challenging because the collaboration, communication, networks, and interactive roles between the PHPs and SHPs are all inadequate. Survivor care plans, more use of health information technology, improved rehabilitation guidelines, and better networks might benefit implementing physical activity programmes.

Impact of team configuration and team stability on primary care quality	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Primary care teams; Quality of care; Clinical performance; Turnover; Staffing mix	CENTERED MEDICAL HOME; IMPLEMENTATION; SYSTEM	BackgroundThe science of effective teams is well documented; far less is known, however, about how specific team configurations may impact primary care team effectiveness. Further, teams experiencing frequent personnel changes (perhaps as a consequence of poor implementation) may have difficulty delivering effective, continuous, well-coordinated care. This study aims to examine the extent to which primary care clinics in the Veterans Health Administration have implemented team configurations consistent with recommendations based on the Patient-Centered Medical Home model and the extent to which adherence to said recommendations, team stability, and role stability impact healthcare quality. Specifically, we expect to find better clinical outcomes in teams that adhere to recommended team configurations, teams whose membership and configuration are more stable over time, and teams whose clinical manager role is more stable over time.Methods/designWe will employ a combination of social network analysis and multilevel modeling to conduct a database review of variables extracted from the Veterans Health Administration's Team Assignments Report (TAR) (one of the largest, most diverse existing national samples of primary care teams (n(teams)>7000)), as well as other employee and clinical data sources. To ensure the examination of appropriate clinical outcomes, we will enlist a team of subject matter experts to select a concise set of clear, prioritized primary care performance metrics. We will accomplish this using the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement System, an evidence-based methodology for developing and implementing performance measurement.DiscussionWe are unaware of other studies of healthcare teams that consider team size, composition, and configuration longitudinally or with sample sizes of this magnitude. Results from this study can inform primary care team implementation policy and practice in both private- and public-sector clinics, such that teams are configured optimally, with adequate staffing, and the right mix of roles within the team.Trial registrationNot applicablethis study does not involve interventions on human participants.

J	van Mierlo, T				van Mierlo, Trevor			The 1% Rule in Four Digital Health Social Networks: An Observational Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social networks; Superusers; eHealth; 1% rule; Pareto Principal; 90-9-1 principle; moderated support	PROBLEM DRINKERS; COMMUNITY	Background: In recent years, cyberculture has informally reported a phenomenon named the 1% rule, or 90-9-1 principle, which seeks to explain participatory patterns and network effects within Internet communities. The rule states that 90% of actors observe and do not participate, 9% contribute sparingly, and 1% of actors create the vast majority of new content. This 90%, 9%, and 1% are also known as Lurkers, Contributors, and Superusers, respectively. To date, very little empirical research has been conducted to verify the 1% rule. Objective: The 1% rule is widely accepted in digital marketing. Our goal was to determine if the 1% rule applies to moderated Digital Health Social Networks (DHSNs) designed to facilitate behavior change. Methods: To help gain insight into participatory patterns, descriptive data were extracted from four long-standing DHSNs: the AlcoholHelpCenter, DepressionCenter, PanicCenter, and StopSmokingCenter sites. Results: During the study period, 63,990 actors created 578,349 posts. Less than 25% of actors made one or more posts. The applicability of the 1% rule was confirmed as Lurkers, Contributors, and Superusers accounted for a weighted average of 1.3% (n=4668), 24.0% (n=88,732), and 74.7% (n=276,034) of content. Conclusions: The 1% rule was consistent across the four DHSNs. As social network sustainability requires fresh content and timely interactions, these results are important for organizations actively promoting and managing Internet communities. Superusers generate the vast majority of traffic and create value, so their recruitment and retention is imperative for long-term success. Although Lurkers may benefit from observing interactions between Superusers and Contributors, they generate limited or no network value. The results of this study indicate that DHSNs may be optimized to produce network effects, positive externalities, and bandwagon effects. Further research in the development and expansion of DHSNs is required.

Optimizing self-management of people with long-term conditions is an important strategy to improve quality of life, health outcomes, patient experiences in healthcare, and the sustainability of healthcare systems. Much research on self-management focuses on individual competencies, while the social systems of support that facilitate self-management are underexplored. The presented study aims to explore the role of social systems of support for self-management and quality of life, focusing on the social networks of people with diabetes and community organisations that serve them. Methods: The protocol concerns a cross-sectional study in 18 geographic areas in six European countries, involving a total of 1800 individuals with diabetes and 900 representatives of community organisations. In each country, we include a deprived rural area, a deprived urban area, and an affluent urban area. Individuals are recruited through healthcare practices in the targeted areas. A patient questionnaire comprises measures for quality of life, self-management behaviours, social network and social support, as well as individual characteristics. A community organisations' survey maps out interconnections between community and voluntary organisations that support patients with chronic illness and documents the scope of work of the different types of organisations. We first explore the structure of social networks of individuals and of community organisations. Then linkages between these social networks, self-management and quality of life will be examined, taking deprivation and other factors into account. Discussion: This study will provide insight into determinants of self-management and quality of life in individuals with diabetes, focusing on the role of social networks and community organisations.

They will allow to identify critical hubs and routes of spreading of Influenza, in specific geographic locations, in order to contain infections and prevent complications, that require hospitalizations. Material and methods: Data were downloaded from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) - SID, New York State database. Patients hospitalized with flu complications, between 2003 and 2012 were included in the research (30,380 cases). A novel approach was designed, by constructing heatmaps for specific geographic regions in New York state and power law networks, in order to analyze distribution of hospitalized flu cases. Results: Heatmaps revealed that distributions of patients follow urban areas and big roads, indicating that flu spreads along routes, that people use to travel. A scale-free network, created from correlations among zip codes, discovered that, the highest populated zip codes didn't have the largest number of patients with flu complications. Among the top five most affected zip codes, four were in Bronx. Demographics of top affected zip codes were presented in results. Normalized numbers of cases per population revealed that, none of zip codes from Bronx were in the top 20. All zip codes with the highest node degrees were in New York City area. Discussion: Heatmaps identified geographic distribution of hospitalized flu patients and network analysis identified hubs of the infection. Our results will enable better estimation of resources for prevention and treatment of hospitalized patients with complications of Influenza. Conclusion: Analyses of geographic distribution of hospitalized patients with Influenza and demographic characteristics of populations, help us to make better planning and management of resources for Influenza patients, that require hospitalization. Obtained results could potentially help to save many lives and improve the health of the population.

A new perspective on proxy report: Investigating implicit processes of understanding through patient-proxy congruence	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Proxy report; Implicit processes of understanding; Personality; Interoception; Neurocognition; Insight; Reserve; Resilience; Health behavior; Multiple sclerosis	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DISABILITY STATUS SCALE; COGNITIVE RESERVE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PERSONALITY; SENSITIVITY; EXPERIENCE; VALIDITY; DECLINE; SCORES	Background Utilizing proxy report is a common solution to gathering quality-of-life information from people who are not capable of reliably answering questionnaires, such as people with dementia. Proxy report could, however, also provide information about patients' implicit processes of understanding, which we define as automatic, schema-driven cognitive processes that allow one to have a better understanding of oneself and of one's body, make oneself known and knowable to members of the social network, and allow one to react proactively in response to cues. We investigated whether implicit processes of understanding explain some of the association between reserve and healthy lifestyle behaviors. Methods We operationalized three implicit processes of understanding: (a) psychosocial understanding; (b) insight into physical disability; and (c) somatic awareness. This secondary analysis involved a cohort of multiple sclerosis patients and their caregiver informants (n = 118 pairs). Measures included a neurologist-administered Expanded Disability Status Scale, patient- and informant-completed survey measures, and a heartbeat perception test (interoception). Patient-other congruence assessed implicit processes of understanding: psychosocial understanding (neurocognitive and personality); physical-disability insight; and somatic awareness (interoception). Results Effect sizes (ES) for the inter-correlations between the three implicit processes were small. Psychosocial understanding was associated with higher past reserve-building activities (small ES). Psychosocial understanding explained variance in healthy lifestyle behaviors over and above the variance explained by current reserve-building activities (Delta R-2 = 0.04; model R-Adjusted(2) = 0.18). Conclusions Proxy versus patient report can provide information about underlying interpretational processes related to insight. These processes are distinct from reserve, predict health outcomes, and can inform lifestyle-changing interventions.

Hardship financing of healthcare among rural poor in Orissa, India	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES; COSTS; ILLNESS; HOUSEHOLDS; COUNTRIES; POVERTY; HOSPITALIZATION; IMPOVERISHMENT; EXPENDITURES; STRATEGIES	Background: This study examines health-related "hardship financing" in order to get better insights on how poor households finance their out-of-pocket healthcare costs. We define hardship financing as having to borrow money with interest or to sell assets to pay out-of-pocket healthcare costs. Methods: Using survey data of 5,383 low-income households in Orissa, one of the poorest states of India, we investigate factors influencing the risk of hardship financing with the use of a logistic regression. Results: Overall, about 25% of the households (that had any healthcare cost) reported hardship financing during the year preceding the survey. Among households that experienced a hospitalization, this percentage was nearly 40%, but even among households with outpatient or maternity-related care around 25% experienced hardship financing. Hardship financing is explained not merely by the wealth of the household (measured by assets) or how much is spent out-of-pocket on healthcare costs, but also by when the payment occurs, its frequency and its duration (e. g. more severe in cases of chronic illnesses). The location where a household resides remains a major predictor of the likelihood to have hardship financing despite all other household features included in the model. Conclusions: Rural poor households are subjected to considerable and protracted financial hardship due to the indirect and longer-term deleterious effects of how they cope with out-of-pocket healthcare costs. The social network that households can access influences exposure to hardship financing. Our findings point to the need to develop a policy solution that would limit that exposure both in quantum and in time. We therefore conclude that policy interventions aiming to ensure health-related financial protection would have to demonstrate that they have reduced the frequency and the volume of hardship financing.

J	Gesser-Edelsburg, A; Cohen, R; Hijazi, R; Shahbari, NAE				Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Cohen, Ricky; Hijazi, Rana; Shahbari, Nour Abed Elhadi			Analysis of Public Perception of the Israeli Government's Early Emergency Instructions Regarding COVID-19: Online Survey Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						covid-19; risk; perception; crisis management; economical threat; compliance to guidelines; spokesperson credibility; source of information credibility; online survey; public health; pandemic	CRISIS-COMMUNICATION; INSIGHTS; SPHERE	Background: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This posed challenges to many countries, prominent among which is communication with the public to gain their cooperation. Israel faces different challenges from other countries in its management of the COVID-19 crisis because it is in the midst of a deep constitutional crisis. Objective: The objective of this paper was to examine the response of the Israeli public to the government's emergency instructions regarding the pandemic in terms of correlations between overall risk perception and crisis management; overall risk perception and economic threat perception; crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines; and crisis management and economic threat perception. We also made comparisons between crisis management and spokesperson credibility and between crisis management and the credibility of information sources. Methods: The sample was established using an online survey that enabled rapid and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (N=1056) through social network posts asking the general public (aged >= 18 years) to answer the survey. Results: Participants aged >= 65 years perceived higher personal risk compared to those aged 18-30 years (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and those aged 46-64 years (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between overall risk perception and attitudes toward crisis management (r=0.19, P<.001), overall risk perception and economic threat perception (r=0.22, P<.001), attitudes toward crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, P<.001), and attitudes toward crisis management and economic threat perception (r=-0.15, P<.001). Participants who perceived that the prime minister was the most credible spokesperson evaluated the crisis management significantly higher than all other groups. The crisis management was evaluated significantly lower by participants who stated that infectious disease specialists were the most credible spokespersons. Participants for whom the Ministry of Health website was the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management higher than all other groups. Participants for whom scientific articles were the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management lower than those who perceived that the WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites or Ministry of Health/hospital websites and health care workers were the most credible. Conclusions: The higher the public trust and evaluation of crisis management, the greater the compliance of the public with guidelines. It was also found that crisis management and information cannot be approached in the same way for the overall public. Furthermore, unlike other epidemics, the COVID-19 crisis has widespread economic and social consequences; therefore, it is impossible to focus only on health risks without communicating economic and social risks as well.

Leading by Example: Web-Based Sexual Health Influencers Among Men Who Have Sex With Men Have Higher HIV and Syphilis Testing Rates in China	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						health promotion; peer influence; internet; social networks; social media; HIV; syphilis; men who have sex with men; China	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SOCIAL NETWORK; PREVALENCE; PREVENTION; ONLINE; BEHAVIORS; INTERNET; GAY; MSM	Background: The spread of healthy behaviors through social networks may be accelerated by influential individuals. Previous studies have used lay health influencers to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among internet-using men who have sex with men (MSM). However, there is a lack of understanding of the characteristics of this key subset of MSM. Objective: This study aimed to examine sociodemographic characteristics, HIV and syphilis testing, and sexual behaviors of Web-based MSM sexual health influencers (SHIs) in China, defined as individuals with relatively stronger influence on spreading HIV and STI information online. Methods: A Web-based survey of MSM was conducted in August 2017 as a final follow-up of a randomized controlled trial promoting HIV testing in 8 Chinese cities. Men were recruited through a gay social networking mobile phone app and were included if they were born biologically male, aged 16 years and above, ever had sex with another man, and HIV negative or with unknown HIV status. Information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and HIV and syphilis testing was obtained. We assessed men's Web-based sexual health influence using a standardized 6-item opinion leadership scale focused on HIV and STI information. Influencers were defined as those whose mean score ranked within the top 13% (a higher score means greater influence). We used multivariable linear and logistic regression models to measure Web-based sexual health influence's association with HIV and syphilis testing, controlling for intervention trial effects, age, education, income, and marital status. Results: Overall, 1031 men completed the survey. Most men were younger than 30 years (819/1031, 79.43%) and had at least college education (667/1031, 64.69%). Influencers were more likely to get tested for HIV (73/132, 55.3% vs 337/899, 37.5%; P<.001) and syphilis (35/132, 26.5% vs 137/899, 15.2%; P=.001) in the last 3 months compared with noninfluencers. There were no significant differences in condomless sex with male partners (26/132, 19.7% vs 203/899, 22.6%; P=.46), mean number of male sex partners (1.32 vs 1.11; P=.16) in the last 3 months, and mainly meeting male sex partners online in the last 12 months (97/132, 73.5% vs 669/899, 74.4%; P=.82) between influencers and noninfluencers. Regression analyses showed that influencers had higher odds of HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 2.16, 95% CI 1.48-3.17) and syphilis testing (AOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.28-3.10) in the last 3 months. Conclusions: We identified Web-based SHIs who might be more likely to help promote healthy HIV and syphilis testing behaviors through MSM populations. Leveraging existing influencers may help improve HIV and syphilis testing among their networks.

Strong evidence shows that perceived loneliness, or inadequate social networks, triggers and increases health problems. How homecare systems address social participation remains unknown; anecdotal data suggests there are significant gaps. This study's objective was to identify and describe how the assessors of homecare needs document social participation among persons with CI and how their documentation corresponds with the services actually provided to meet social needs. The research questions were: How and what kinds of social participation needs are documented on need assessment forms? What types of homecare services (with a social focus) are documented and approved? How are specified needs in social participation profiles addressed by a homecare service? Methods: Descriptive data from need assessment forms and their attached care plans for all applicants aged 65+ were collected during a 2 month period from a large homecare agency serving a municipality in Sweden. Persons with documented CI (n = 43) in the group were identified. Qualitative data analysis was conducted to examine the research questions. Results: Social participation factors were not documented consistently. The relationship between recognition of limitations to social participation and approval of service eligibility was not consistent. Social participation was designated by references to social status, sometimes by social network size, and occasionally by limitations to social participation. The range of approved homecare services (with social focus) covered services such as day care center visits or companionship. Three profiles of social participation were identified: clients with, (a) no participation limitations; (b) potential limitations; and (c) marked limitations. Conclusion: Given the known health harms from social isolation and the high risk of isolation among older persons with CI, this novel study's documentation of inadequate and inconsistent information in homecare social need assessments and services is sobering. The findings suggest a pressing need for initiatives to formulate best practices and standards to ensure alignment of care service systems to the health needs of the growing group of aging individuals with CI.

Each triad comprising a patient, a family member/friend, a care provider and documents the procedural, analytic of triangulating perspectives as a means of understanding the recovery process which is illustrated by four case studies. Variations are considered as they relate to individual characteristics, type of participant (patient, family, member/friend and care provider), and mental illness. This paper which is part of a larger study and is based on a qualitative research design documents the process of recovery of people with mental illness: Developing a Model of Recovery in Mental Health: A middle range theory. Methods : Data were collected in field notes through semi-structured interviews based on three interview guides (one for patients, one for family members/friends, and one for caregivers). Cross analysis and triangulation methods were used to analyse the areas of convergence and divergence on the recovery process of all triads. Results: In general, with the 36 participants united in 12 triads, two themes emerge from the cross-analysis process or triangulation of data sources (12 triads analysis in 12 cases studies). Two themes emerge from the analysis process of the content of 36 interviews with participants: (1) Revealing dynamic context, situating patients in their dynamic context; and (2) Relationship issues in a recovery process, furthering our understanding of such issues. We provide four case studies examples (among 12 cases studies) to illustrate the variations in the way recovery is perceived, interpreted and expressed in relation to the different contexts of interaction. Conclusion: The perspectives of the three participants (patients, family members/friends and care providers) suggest that recovery depends on constructing meaning around mental illness experiences and that the process is based on each person's dynamic context (e. g., social network, relationship), life experiences and other social determinants (e. g., symptoms, environment). The findings of this study add to existing knowledge about the determinants of the recovery of persons suffering with a mental illness and significant other utilizing public mental health services in Montreal, Canada.

J	Jakobsen, MD; Obstfelder, A; Braaten, T; Abelsen, B				Jakobsen, Monika Dybdahl; Obstfelder, Aud; Braaten, Tonje; Abelsen, Birgit			What makes women with food hypersensitivity do self-management work?	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Food hypersensitivity; Chronic conditions; Motivation; Resources; Conservation of resources (COR) theory; Self-determination theory	PATIENT ADHERENCE; ALLERGY; INTOLERANCE; BURDEN; PASSAGEWAYS; ADOLESCENTS; CARAVANS	BackgroundManaging a chronic condition takes work, and it is considered important that patients carry out this work. However, knowledge is lacking on what elements enhance self-management work.Persons with food hypersensitivity (FH) seem to do self-management work despite the relatively little support they receive. Our aim is to explore what makes women with FH carry out the work of managing their condition. Our research will shed light on the health care needs of women with FH and contribute to the knowledge on self-management among persons with chronic conditions.MethodsWe used the Self-determination theory and the Conservation of resources theory to analyze 16 qualitative individual interviews with women with FH aged 39-67years.ResultsOur participants reported that eating selected foods resulted in uncomfortable symptoms, and their main motivation for carrying out self-management work was the wish to avoid these symptoms and their consequences.Participants' individual resources were crucial to the management of FH, and those who had a social network that included people with relevant competencies clearly benefited from this.Hindrances to the management of FH included competing priorities and not wanting to break with the social expectation of sharing a meal.ConclusionsWomen with FH carried out self-management work because they were highly motivated. Important motivators included the uncomfortable symptoms that resulted from consuming some foods, which had negative consequences on their lives or could bring shame. The ability to perform self-management work was dependent on the availability of individual and social resources. Indeed, women with FH who have the individual and social resources necessary to manage their condition may not need health services, whereas those who do not have these resources, or have significant competing priorities, may need assistance from health services.The desire to avoid uncomfortable symptoms can be a motivator for persons with chronic conditions to do self-management work, while a lack of symptoms can reduce motivation. The competing role of basic needs can take two forms: when fulfilled, these needs may contribute to self-management work; however, people may opt out of self-management in order to fulfil basic needs.

J	Elran-Barak, R				Elran-Barak, Roni			Analyses of posts written in online eating disorder and depression/anxiety moderated communities: Emotional and informational communication before and during the COVID-19 outbreak	INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH			English	Article						Eating disorders; Depression; Online health communities; Emotional and informational posts; Covid-19	SOCIAL SUPPORT; HEALTH COMMUNITIES; PRO-ANOREXIA; INTERNET; HELP; SEEKING; PEOPLE; IMPACT; FORUMS; ISSUES	Introduction: Moderated online health communities (OHCs) are digital platforms that provide a means for patients with similar medical conditions to communicate with each other under the supervision of healthcare professionals. Aims: To examine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on content and type of posts published in two moderated OHCs - eating disorders and depression/anxiety - by comparing categorizations of posts written before vs. after the lockdown, and about vs. not about the pandemic. Methods: Posts were retrieved from Camoni, the first Israeli medical social network (January-June 2017, March -May 2020). A total of 1475 posts were analyzed. Of them, 802 posts were written before and 680 were written during the first lockdown. Posts were divided into two main categories: informational and emotional, and into fourteen subcategories. Results: Before the pandemic, the eating disorders OHC was characterized as primarily emotional (emotional: 66.7%, informational: 45.4%) and the depression/anxiety OHC as primarily informational (emotional: 49.8%, informational: 65.8%) (chi(2) = 31.6, p < 0.001). During the lockdown, there was a transition in the eating disorders community, from primarily emotional to primarily informational communication (emotional: 46.1%, informa-tional: 71.7%) (chi(2) = 30.3, p < 0.001). In both OHCs, only about one in six posts written during the lockdown was related to the pandemic. There were only minimal differences in subcategorization of posts written before vs. after the outbreak (e.g., searching for medical information was more common during the pandemic: chi(2) = 40.9, p < 0.001), as well as about vs. not about the pandemic (e.g., sharing negative emotions was more common when writing about the pandemic: chi(2) = 4.1, p = 0.43). Conclusion: During the first lockdown, people with eating disorders have increased their use of OHCs as sources of informational (as opposed to emotional) support, but the overall impact of the pandemic on the content of posts written in the examined OHCs was minimal, suggesting that OHCs have not changed their function as a valuable means of providing emotional and informational support for people with mental difficulties.

Facebook Apps for Smoking Cessation: A Review of Content and Adherence to Evidence-Based Guidelines	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Review						Facebook; smoking cessation/methods; social media; apps	SMARTPHONE APPS	Background: Facebook is the most popular social network site, with over 1 billion users globally. There are millions of apps available within Facebook, many of which address health and health behavior change. Facebook may represent a promising channel to reach smokers with cessation interventions via apps. To date, there have been no published reports about Facebook apps for smoking cessation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to review the features and functionality of Facebook apps for smoking cessation and to determine the extent to which they adhere to evidence-based guidelines for tobacco dependence treatment. Methods: In August 2013, we searched Facebook and three top Internet search engines using smoking cessation keywords to identify relevant Facebook apps. Resultant apps were screened for eligibility (smoking cessation-related, English language, and functioning). Eligible apps were reviewed by 2 independent coders using a standardized coding scheme. Coding included content features (interactive, informational, and social) and adherence to an established 20-item index (possible score 0-40) derived from the US Public Health Service's Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. Results: We screened 22 apps for eligibility; of these, 12 underwent full coding. Only 9 apps were available on Facebook. Facebook apps fell into three broad categories: public pledge to quit (n=3), quit-date-based calculator/tracker (n=4), or a multicomponent quit smoking program (n=2). All apps incorporated interactive, informational, and social features except for two quit-date-based calculator/trackers apps (lacked informational component). All apps allowed app-related posting within Facebook (ie, on self/other Facebook profile), and four had a within-app "community" feature to enable app users to communicate with each other. Adherence index summary scores among Facebook apps were low overall (mean 15.1, SD 7.8, range 7-30), with multicomponent apps scoring the highest. Conclusions: There are few smoking cessation apps available within Facebook. Among those available, adherence to cessation treatment guidelines was low. Smoking cessation interventions provided via the Facebook platform are a unique and as yet untapped treatment strategy that can harness existing social support and social networks for quitting. Research is needed to examine whether apps that adhere to clinical practice guidelines for tobacco dependence treatment are more effective in promoting cessation than those that do not.

The lives of informal caregivers of cancer patients may also be affected by the patient's cancer diagnosis; however, they may also find benefits in their experiences. Noticeable changes are reported in personal priorities after an oncologic diagnosis that can lead individuals to restructure their values and the way they perceive life. This study aims to assess happiness/satisfaction with life and positive and negative affect in cancer patients and informal caregivers compared with healthy people in the general population. Methods A cross-sectional study with participants recruited online in five regions of Brazil through the social network site Facebook (R) and the application WhatsApp (R). Surveys were completed using the SurveyMonkey (R) platform. A different sample of cancer patients and informal caregivers that was personally interviewed with the same forms was also grouped in the present analysis. Variables withp-values < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were included in linear regression models (stepwise, backward). Results A total of 2580 participants were included, of whom 2112 were healthy representatives of the general population, 342 were cancer patients, and 126 were informal caregivers of cancer patients. In the multivariate analysis, the cancer patients and informal caregivers were happier than the healthy people in the general population, even after controlling for age, sex, educational level, and income. The patients and caregivers had lower scores for positive affect and higher scores for negative affect. Conclusions Overall, the conditions related to happiness, satisfaction with life and positive affect are similar for all groups. However, cancer patients and informal caregivers report increased rates of happiness and satisfaction with life compared with theoretically healthy people, although they have lower positive affect scores and higher negative affect scores. It is suggested that cancer patients and caregivers of cancer patients experience more difficulties (suffering) on a daily basis.

This protocol paper outlines an implementation-effectiveness study of the Integrated Solutions for Sustainable Fall Prevention (iSOLVE) intervention which has developed integrated processes and pathways to identify older people at risk of falls and engage a whole of primary care approach to fall prevention. Methods/design: This protocol paper presents the iSOLVE implementation processes and change strategies and outlines the study design of a blended type 2 hybrid design. The study consists of a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial in 28 general practices and recruiting 560 patients in Sydney, Australia, to evaluate effectiveness of the iSOLVE intervention in changing general practitioner fall management practices and reducing patient falls and the cost effectiveness from a healthcare funder perspective. Secondary outcomes include change in medications known to increase fall risk. We will simultaneously conduct a multi-methodology evaluation to investigate the workability and utility of the implementation intervention. The implementation evaluation includes in-depth interviews and surveys with general practitioners and allied health professionals to explore acceptability and uptake of the intervention, the coherence of the proposed changes for those in the work setting, and how to facilitate the collective action needed to implement changes in practice; social network mapping will explore professional relationships and influences on referral patterns; and, a survey of GPs in the geographical intervention zone will test diffusion of evidence-based fall prevention practices. The project works in partnership with a primary care health network, state fall prevention leaders, and a community of practice of fall prevention advocates. Discussion: The design is aimed at providing clear direction for sustainability and informing decisions about generalization of the iSOLVE intervention processes and change strategies. While challenges exist in hybrid designs, there is a potential for significant outcomes as the iSOLVE pathways project brings together practice and research to collectively solve a major national problem with implications for policy service delivery.

J	Badger, TA; Segrin, C; Meek, P				Badger, Terry A.; Segrin, Chris; Meek, Paula			Development and Validation of an Instrument for Rapidly Assessing Symptoms: The General Symptom Distress Scale	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Symptoms; symptom distress; instrumentation; psychometric evaluation	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH; CANCER-PATIENTS; BREAST-CANCER; NEGATIVE AFFECT; HEALTH SURVEY; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; WOMEN; INTERVENTION	Context. Symptom assessment has increasingly focused on the evaluation of total symptom distress or burden rather than assessing only individual symptoms. The challenge for clinicians and researchers alike is to assess symptoms, and to determine the symptom distress associated with the symptoms and the patient's ability for symptom management without a lengthy and burdensome assessment process. Objectives. The objective of this article was to discuss the psychometric evaluation of a brief general symptom distress scale (GSDS) developed to assess specific symptoms and how they rank in relation to each other, the overall symptom distress associated with the symptom schema, and provide an assessment of how well or poorly that symptom schema is managed. Methods. Results from a pilot study about the initial development of the GSDS with 76 hospitalized patients are presented, followed by a more complete psychometric evaluation of the GSDS using three samples of cancer patients (n = 190) and their social network members, called partners in these studies (n = 94). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the GSDS symptoms, symptom distress, and symptom management. Point biserial correlations indexed the associations between dichotomous symptoms and continuous measures, and conditional probabilities were used to illustrate the substantial comorbidities of this sample. Internal consistency was examined using the KR-20 coefficient, and test-retest reliability was examined. Construct validity and predictive validity also were examined. Results. The GSDS demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and good construct validity and predictive validity. The total score on the GSDS, symptom distress, and symptom management correlated significantly with related constructs of depression, positive and negative affect, and general health. The GSDS was able to demonstrate its ability to distinguish between those with or without chronic illness, and was able to significantly predict scores on criterion measures such as depression. Conclusion. Collectively, these results suggest that the GSDS is a straightforward and useful instrument for rapidly assessing symptoms that can disrupt health-related quality of life.

J	Huh, J; Marmor, R; Jiang, XQ				Huh, Jina; Marmor, Rebecca; Jiang, Xiaoqian			Lessons Learned for Online Health Community Moderator Roles: A Mixed-Methods Study of Moderators Resigning From WebMD Communities	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						qualitative research; online systems; social network; information science; Internet; social support; user computer interface; health information technologies; public health informatics; consumer health information	BREAST-CANCER; SUPPORT GROUPS; INTERNET; INFORMATION; MIGRATION; WOMEN; PEER	Background: Online health community (OHC) moderators help facilitate conversations and provide information to members. However, the necessity of the moderator in helping members achieve goals by providing the support they need remains unclear, with some prior research suggesting that moderation is unnecessary or even harmful for close-knit OHCs. Similarly, members' perceptions of moderator roles are underexplored. Starting January of 2013, WebMD moderators stopped working for WebMD communities. This event provided an opportunity for us to study the perceived role of moderators in OHCs. Objective: We examine the OHC members' perception on OHC moderators by studying their reactions toward the departure of moderators in their communities. We also analyzed the relative posting activity on OHCs before and after the departure of moderators from the communities among all members and those who discussed moderators' departures. Methods: We applied a mixed-methods approach to study the posts of all 55 moderated WebMD communities by querying the terms relating to discussions surrounding moderators' disappearance from the WebMD community. We performed open and axial coding and affinity diagramming to thematically analyze patients' reactions to the disappeared moderators. The number of posts and poster groups (members and moderators) were analyzed over time to understand posting patterns around moderators' departure. Results: Of 821 posts retrieved under 95 threads, a total of 166 open codes were generated. The codes were then grouped into 2 main themes with 6 total subthemes. First, patients attempted to understand why moderators had left and what could be done to fill the void left by the missing moderators. During these discussions, the posts revealed that patients believed that moderators played critical roles in the communities by making the communities vibrant and healthy, finding solutions, and giving medical information. Some patients felt personally attached with moderators, expressing they would cease their community participation. On the other hand, patients also indicated that moderators were not useful or sometimes even harmful for peer interactions. The overall communities' posting activity, which was already in decline, showed no significant difference before and after the moderators' departure. In fact, the overall posting activities of the communities were declining well before the moderators' departure. These declining posting activities might be the reason why WebMD removed the moderators. Conclusion: Compassionate moderators who provide medical expertise, control destructive member posts, and help answer questions can provide important support for patient engagement in OHCs. Moderators are in general received positively by community members and do not appear to interfere with peer interactions. Members are well aware of the possibility of misinformation spreading in OHCs. Further investigation into the attitudes of less vocal community members should be conducted.

Supervisors' pedagogies for supporting interns to learn intra- and interprofessional collaboration: a qualitative and quantitative ego network analysis	JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE			English	Article						Interprofessional collaboration; Professional relations; Work-based learning; Supervisors; Clerkships	HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS; SOCIAL NETWORKS	This work aims to understand intra- and interprofessional networks of general practitioners (GPs) and ear, nose, and throat specialists (ENT specialists), and in what manner supervisors in these specialties involve interns in their professional network to help them learn intra- and interprofessional collaboration. An egocentric social network approach was used to collect and analyze quantitative as well as qualitative data. For this, semi-structured interviews were held with ten GP and ten ENT specialists. GPs had significantly more interprofessional contacts than ENT specialists (p < .01), with no significant difference in the network sizes of both professions (p = .37). All supervisors involved interns in their (ego)network actively as well as more passively. They actively discussed how collaboration with other professionals evolved, or passively assumed that an intern would learn from observing the supervisors' network interactions. Many supervisors considered the interns' initiative essential in deciding to involve an intern in their network. Although the workplace of GPs differed notably from hospital settings where ENT specialists work, the network sizes of both were comparable. Clerkships at the general practice seemed to provide more opportunities to learn interprofessional collaboration, for example with the medical nurse. Supervisors in both specialties could involve interns more actively in their intra- and interprofessional network while interns could take more initiative to learn collaboration from their supervisors' network.

Coping with and factors impacting upon the experience of lung cancer in patients and primary carers	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE			English	Article						lung cancer; coping; distress; supportive care; qualitative research; patient/carer experience	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SOCIAL SUPPORT; DIAGNOSIS; DISTRESS; SITUATION; SYMPTOMS; SPOUSES	(T)here is a paucity of research exploring patients' and their informal carers' experience of coping with and factors impacting on the lung cancer experience. This study aims to explore how patients and their informal carers cope with a diagnosis of lung cancer and describe the key factors that mediate distress in this population in order that they may be better supported in the future. This was a qualitative study employing semi-structured interviews and framework analysis to elicit the experience of 37 patients with lung cancer and 23 primary carers regarding their coping with and factors influencing patient/carer distress. The findings illustrate that participants used both emotional-and problem-focused coping strategies, including accepting the reality of lung cancer, adopting a positive attitude/fighting spirit, denial, avoidance and distraction and information seeking. Maintaining normality was also important. Key factors that mediate the lung cancer experience were also identified including hope, social network, prior experience of cancer and other chronic illnesses, the competing coping strategies of patients and their primary carers, the unpredictable nature of patients' behaviour, changing symptomatology, the perceived attitudes of health professionals and the impact of perceived delays in diagnosis. This study provides important insights into how patients with lung cancer and their primary carers might be better supported.	[Ellis, J.; Williams, M.

Navigated African American breast cancer patients as incidental change agents in their family/friend networks	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article; Early Access						African American; Patient navigation; Survivor advocates; Social networks	MISTRUST; IMPACT; WOMEN; STATE; CARE	Background Patient navigation is an increasingly widespread intervention to address the persistent, severe, and disproportionate breast cancer (BC) burden that African Americans (AA) face. Navigation may have more widespread effects than previously estimated due to patient-driven diffusion of BC information. Methods This pilot study examined the network effects of a randomized controlled trial via recruitment of navigated and non-navigated AA BC patients as well as their network members. We estimated study arm differences in patient BC promotion (i.e., number of individuals to whom BC patients promote BC screening) and network BC screening (i.e., % BC screening among network members). Results Among our sample of 100 AA BC patients, navigated patients promoted BC screening to more individuals than non-navigated patients. BC patients were more likely to promote BC screening to children and individuals with whom they communicated more frequently. Some models further suggested more network BC screening among "navigated" network members relative to "non-navigated" network members. Conclusions Navigated AA patients promoted BC screening more widely throughout their networks than non-navigated AA BC patients. There were also suggestive findings regarding increased BC screening among their network members. Our pilot study highlights the potential for social network analysis to improve the precision of intervention effect estimates and to inform future innovations (e.g., integrating navigation and network-based interventions) with multilevel effects on cancer health disparities.

J	Theriault, N; Bi, P; Hiller, JE; Nor, M				Theriault, Nathanaelle; Bi, Peng; Hiller, Janet E.; Nor, Mahdi			Use of Web 2.0 to Recruit Australian Gay Men to an Online HIV/AIDS Survey	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Internet; advertising; HIV; Australia; homosexuality; male	SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED-DISEASES; HEALTH-PROMOTION; HIV RISK; INTERNET; SEX; INTERVENTION; PREVENTION; RESEARCHERS; BAREBACKING; RETENTION	Background: Continuous prevention efforts for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are recommended among those men who have sex with men (MSM). Creative use of e-technologies coupled with a better understanding of social networks could lead to improved health interventions among this risk population. Objective: The aims of the study were to (1) compare the impact of various advertising strategies on recruiting MSM participants to an online HIV/AIDS survey, and (2) explore the feasibility of using a social network service (SNS) for study advertising. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in 2009. South Australian men over 18 years were invited to participate if they had had sexual intercourse with men in the previous year. A short questionnaire was used to collect demographics and information on sexual behavior, HIV history, use of the Internet for dating purposes, and sources of health information. The survey was promoted in community settings and online, including advertisements through social networks. Results: A total of 243 men completed the online survey during the 8-week data collection period. Online advertisements recruited 91.7% (220/240) of the sample. Conversely, traditional advertisements in the community recruited only 5.8% (14/240) of the sample. Ten volunteers were asked to advertise on their personal SNS application, but only 2 effectively did so. Only 18/240 (7.5%) of the respondents reported having learned of our study through the SNS application. In this sample, 19.3% (47/243) of participants had never been tested for HIV. Among the participants who had been tested, 12.8% (25/196) reported being HIV-positive. Regarding Internet use, 82.3% (200/243) of participants had dated online in the previous 6 months. Among the participants who had dated online, most (175/200, 87.5%) had found an Internet sexual partner and two-thirds (132/200, 66.0%) had had anal sex with these partner(s). Among men who had anal sex with an Internet partner, 68.2% (90/132) used a condom during sex. Conclusions: The MSM participants in this study had high-risk profiles for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which highlights the need for ongoing health interventions among this group. In this study, the SNS marketing strategy did not appear to create a viral effect and it had a relatively poor yield.

Based on Lazarus's transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesize that individual differences in the appraisal of media predict variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. Methods: Between March 20 and April 20, 2020, a brief snowball survey entitled: "What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens" was distributed via Concordia University's mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media repertoire method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in use, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, and ignore) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media use by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender, and self-reported mental health. Results: More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the United States. From 685 completed responses, 169 respondents were "very stressed" and 452 were "slightly worried" about the pandemic. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook (chi(2)(3) =11.76, P=.008), television (chi(2)(3) =12.40, P=.006), YouTube (chi(2)(3) =8.577, P=.04), and streaming services such as Netflix (chi(2)(3) =10.71, P=.01). Respondents who considered their mental health "not good" were twice as likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and nonbinary respondents were twice as likely than men to pick social media for coping. Individuals younger than 35 years were 3 times more likely to pick computer games, and individuals older than 55 years were more likely to pick network television or print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (less in men than others) in terms of avoid (F-1,F-637 =5.84, P=.02) and approach scores (F-1,F-637 =14.31, P<.001). Subjective mental health affected the ignore score (less in those who said "good" than others; F-1,F-637=1 3.88, P<.001). The appraisal score and use increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) were important for coping if they provided support and connection through the dissemination of factual and positive information while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news. Conclusions: The relationship between appraisal of media's positive and negative facets vary with demographic differences in mental health resiliency. The media repertoire approach is an important tool in studies that focus on assessing the benefits and harms of screen overuse in different populations, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Piil, K; Nordentoft, S; Larsen, A; Jarden, M				Piil, Karin; Nordentoft, Sara; Larsen, Anders; Jarden, Mary			Bereaved caregivers of patients with high-grade glioma: a systematic review	BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE			English	Review							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; OF-LIFE PHASE; BRAIN-TUMOR; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; DISTRESS; CARE; GLIOBLASTOMA; RADIOTHERAPY; PERSPECTIVE; EXPERIENCE	Objective Caregivers to patients with primary malignant brain tumours neglect their own physical and emotional needs during the disease trajectory. The aim of the systematic review was to explore how informal caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain tumour (high-grade glioma (HGG)) experience and manage their life situation after the death of the patient. Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in December 2016 and revised in September 2017. The following six databases were searched: PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica database, Scopus, PsycINFO and The Social Sciences Citation Index. Studies eligible for inclusion met the following criteria: (1) included bereaved caregivers to patients diagnosed with HGG >= 18 years, (2) described the caregiver's perspective at post bereavement (3) had been peer-reviewed. The papers included were assessed for methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Results Four qualitative articles, published from 2004 to 2015, met the eligibility criteria. Bereaved informal caregivers expressed profound grief and had unmet needs and questions related to the disease and their role as caregiver. Moreover, they experienced depressive symptoms and fatigue, resulting in a reduced work capability and social network. Conclusions We conclude that bereaved informal caregivers experience psychosocial consequences and emotional reactions after bereavement, resulting in feelings of isolation and loneliness. This review identified limited evidence on how the bereaved caregivers prefer to be supported, and further study is warranted. We suggest incorporating systematic information on bereavement in clinical practice and a cooperation across sectors.

J	Reinwand, DA; Crutzen, R; Zank, S				Reinwand, Dominique A.; Crutzen, Rik; Zank, Susanne			Online activities among elder informal caregivers: Results from a cross-sectional study	DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article						Informal caregiver; internet use; online activities; older people	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; SUPPORT SERVICES; FAMILY CARERS; OLDER-ADULTS; HEALTH; INTERVENTIONS; INTERNET; IMPACT; STRESS; CANCER	Objectives: The internet can be used as a source to gain information or support during highly demanding circumstances, e.g. providing informal care. While internet use has been studied among older people, less is known about informal caregivers' online behaviour. This study aims to explore differences in internet use regarding online activities between informal caregivers and non-caregivers. Methods: We used data of the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel (2014), including people aged 65 and older (N = 1413). To test differences with regard to 15 common internet activities; descriptive statistics and chi(2) tests were conducted. Results: The sample included 1197 participants aged 65 and older, and 325 (27.2%) were identified as informal caregivers. It was found that informal caregivers played more online games (chi(2) (1, 1198)=6.20, p= 0.01), while non-caregivers more often read online news (chi(2) (1, 1198) = 4.44, p= 0.04) and were more active on social network websites (chi(2) (1, 1198) = 5.07, p= 0.02) compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: Based on a representative sample, the results show that informal caregivers do not use the internet more for information seeking, but more often for playing online games, which may indicate that the internet is used to compensate for stress. Further research is needed to identify how informal caregivers can be supported by online services.

The objectives of this study were to map the intellectual structure of the studies of medication errors and adverse drug events and to investigate the developing path of this literature and interrelationships among the main topics. Methods The Web of Science database was searched for documentation of medication errors and adverse drug events from 1961 to 2013. The most cited articles and references were profiled and analyzed using HistCite software to draw a historiograph and Ucinet software to draw a sociogram. Results The database search revealed 3343 medication errors and 3342 adverse drug event documents. The most cited articles on medication errors focused on 3 key themes from 1961 to 2013, namely, medication errors in adult inpatients, computerized physician order entry in medication error studies, and medication errors in pediatric inpatients. The developing path for the most cited articles about adverse drug events from 1987 to 2013 was as follows: detection, analysis, effect, and prevention from adult inpatient to pediatric inpatient settings and from hospitalized care to ambulatory care. In addition, social network analysis based on the most cited references revealed a close relationship between medication errors and adverse drug events. Conclusions The mapping results provide a valuable tool for researchers to access the literature in this field and can be used to help identify the direction of medication errors and adverse drug events research.

As a discipline, IPE has moved from being widely atheoretical to having a plethora of theories imported from the psychosocial disciplines that have utility to understand, articulate and improve IPE practice and evaluation. This paper proposes that when taking this deductive approach to theoretical development in IPE, a greater focus must now be placed on the rigorous testing of these theories within the IPE context. It synthesizes two approaches to achieving this, using the social capital theory as a case study, and focuses on the first two stages of this synthesis: first, the identification of the concepts and propositions that make up a theory within the study context and second, the value-based judgments made by the researcher and other stakeholders on the utility of these propositions. The interprofessional student group is chosen as a possible exemplar of a social network and theory-derived concepts and propositions are identified and classified within this context. With a focus on physical network characteristics, validation of these propositions with a sample of IPE educationalists is described. We present a range of propositions specifically related to the size and mix of IPE student groups, the frequency and level with which students participate in these as well as some of the existing evidence that have explored these propositions to date. Refined propositions and the way forward in the future application and empirical testing of social capital theory in IPE are presented.

Use of electronic clinical documentation: time spent and team interactions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; MEDICAL-RECORD; PATIENT-CARE; PHYSICIANS; EFFICIENCY; NURSES; ACCESS; ERRORS; IMPACT; WORK	Objective To measure the time spent authoring and viewing documentation and to study patterns of usage in healthcare practice. Design Audit logs for an electronic health record were used to calculate rates, and social network analysis was applied to ascertain usage patterns. Subjects comprised all care providers at an urban academic medical center who authored or viewed electronic documentation. Measurement Hate and time of authoring and viewing clinical documentation, and associations among users were measured. Results Users spent 20-103 min per day authoring notes and 7-56 min per day viewing notes, with physicians spending less than 90 min per day total. About 16% of attendings' notes, 8% of residents' notes, and 38% of nurses' notes went unread by other users, and, overall, 16% of notes were never read by anyone. Viewing of notes dropped quickly with the age of the note, but notes were read at a low but measurable rate, even after 2 years. Most healthcare teams (77%) included a nurse, an attending, and a resident, and those three users' groups were the first to write notes during an admission. Limitations The limitations were restriction to a single academic medical center and use of log files without direct observation. Conclusions Care providers spend a significant amount of time viewing and authoring notes. Many notes are never read, and rates of usage vary significantly by author and viewer.

The association between social isolation and musculoskeletal health in older community-dwelling adults: findings from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Social isolation; BMD; Physical capability; Depression; Anxiety; Older adults		Purpose Social isolation has been associated with both physical and psychological adverse outcomes and is prevalent in older adults. We investigated the impact of social isolation on bone mineral density (BMD) and physical capability in community-dwelling older adults. Methods Data were collected in 2011 and 2017 from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study. In 2011, we assessed social isolation using the six-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) and the Maastricht Social Participation Profile (MSSP) and depressive and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Physical capability was assessed by performing tests of gait speed, chair stands, timed up and go and balance at both time points. BMD was assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at both time points. Results Data were available from 369 participants in 2011 and 184 in 2017. Forty percent of men and 42.4% of women were socially isolated. Isolated participants had higher odds of depressive disorder (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.27-7.11, p < 0.02). Social isolation at baseline was associated with poor physical capability scores at follow-up (OR 5.53, 95% CI 1.09-27.99, p < 0.04). No associations were found between social isolation and BMD at either time point. Conclusions Social isolation was associated with higher odds of having depressive symptoms and predicted the development of poor physical capability 6 years later. Further longitudinal studies that include loneliness as a covariate are warranted.

J	Long, JC; Cunningham, FC; Braithwaite, J				Long, Janet C.; Cunningham, Frances C.; Braithwaite, Jeffrey			Bridges, brokers and boundary spanners in collaborative networks: a systematic review	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Review						Brokerage; Collaborative networks; Structural holes; Social network theory; Knowledge transfer	STRUCTURAL HOLES; OPINION LEADERS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; CONSEQUENCES; INVOLVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; SAFETY	Background: Bridges, brokers and boundary spanners facilitate transactions and the flow of information between people or groups who either have no physical or cognitive access to one another, or alternatively, who have no basis on which to trust each other. The health care sector is a context that is rich in isolated clusters, such as silos and professional "tribes," in need of connectivity. It is a key challenge in health service management to understand, analyse and exploit the role of key agents who have the capacity to connect disparate groupings in larger systems. Methods: The empirical, peer reviewed, network theory literature on brokerage roles was reviewed for the years 1994 to 2011 following PRISMA guidelines. Results: The 24 articles that made up the final literature set were from a wide range of settings and contexts not just healthcare. Methods of data collection, analysis, and the ways in which brokers were identified varied greatly. We found four main themes addressed in the literature: identifying brokers and brokerage opportunities, generation and integration of innovation, knowledge brokerage, and trust. The benefits as well as the costs of brokerage roles were examined. Conclusions: Collaborative networks by definition, seek to bring disparate groups together so that they can work effectively and synergistically together. Brokers can support the controlled transfer of specialised knowledge between groups, increase cooperation by liaising with people from both sides of the gap, and improve efficiency by introducing "good ideas" from one isolated setting into another. There are significant costs to brokerage. Densely linked networks are more efficient at diffusing information to all their members when compared to sparsely linked groups. This means that while a bridge across a structural hole allows information to reach actors that were previously isolated, it is not the most efficient way to transfer information. Brokers who become the holders of, or the gatekeepers to, specialised knowledge or resources can become overwhelmed by the role and so need support in order to function optimally.

The lack of estimates of the value of informal care has led to its omission in economic evaluations but this can result in incorrect decisions about cost effectiveness of an intervention. We explore the use of contingent valuation methods of willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) to estimate the value of informal care provided to HIV infected women that are accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) under the Option B+ approach to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV in Malawi. Methods: We collected cross sectional data from 93 caregivers of women that received ART care from six health facilities in Malawi. Caregivers of women that reported for ART care on the survey day and consented to participate in the survey were included until the targeted sample size for the facility was reached. We estimated the value of informal care by using the willingness to accept (WTA) and willingness to pay (WTP) approaches. Medians were used to summarize the values and these were compared by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: The median WTA to provide informal care in a month was US$ 30 and the median WTP for informal care was US$ 13 and the two were statistically different (p < 0.000). Median WTP was higher in the urban areas than in the rural areas (US$ 21 vs. US$ 13, p < 0.001) and for caregivers from households from higher wealth quintile than in the lower quintile (US$ 15 vs. US$ 13, p < 0.0462). Conclusion: Informal caregivers place substantial value on informal care giving. In low income settings where most caregivers are not formally employed, WTP and WTA approaches can be used to value informal care.

Using Social Media to Characterize Public Sentiment Toward Medical Interventions Commonly Used for Cancer Screening: An Observational Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Twitter; sentiment analysis; cancer screening; colonoscopy; mammography; Pap smear; Papanicolaou test; social media; early detection of cancer	COLORECTAL-CANCER; INFODEMIOLOGY; COMMUNICATION; EXPERIENCE; ADHERENCE; COLON; TEXT	Background: Although cancer screening reduces morbidity and mortality, millions of people worldwide remain unscreened. Social media provide a unique platform to understand public sentiment toward tools that are commonly used for cancer screening. Objective: The objective of our study was to examine public sentiment toward colonoscopy, mammography, and Pap smear and how this sentiment spreads by analyzing discourse on Twitter. Methods: In this observational study, we classified 32,847 tweets (online postings on Twitter) related to colonoscopy, mammography, or Pap smears using a naive Bayes algorithm as containing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Additionally, we characterized the spread of sentiment on Twitter using an established model to study contagion. Results: Colonoscopy-related tweets were more likely to express negative than positive sentiment (negative to positive ratio 1.65, 95% CI 1.51-1.80, P<.001), in contrast to the more positive sentiment expressed regarding mammography (negative to positive ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.39-0.47, P<.001). The proportions of negative versus positive tweets about Pap smear were not significantly different (negative to positive ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.04, P=.18). Positive and negative tweets tended to share lexical features across screening modalities. Positive tweets expressed resonance with the benefits of early detection. Fear and pain were the principal lexical features seen in negative tweets. Negative sentiment for colonoscopy and mammography spread more than positive sentiment; no correlation with sentiment and spread was seen for Pap smear. Conclusions: Analysis of social media data provides a unique, quantitative framework to better understand the public's perception of medical interventions that are commonly used for cancer screening. Given the growing use of social media, public health interventions to improve cancer screening should use the health perceptions of the population as expressed in social network postings about tests that are frequently used for cancer screening, as well as other people they may influence with such postings.

Effective mental health care for youth from these families is currently lacking, urging research on new methods. The InConnection approach is an integrated care program to improve resilience in multi-problem families by connecting the professional expertise from multiple disciplines with the informal social network of the youth. Specifically, youth are asked to nominate ayouth initiated mentor(YIM) from among the supportive adults in their network. The aim of this protocol is to describe the design of a mixed-methods study to examine the effectiveness and working mechanisms of the InConnection approach. Method/design: The effectiveness of the InConnection approach is studied in a quasi-experimental questionnaire study using propensity score matching, withN = 300 families with youth aged 10-23 years receiving treatment in either the intervention group (InConnection approach) or the control group (care as usual). The main outcome variables include youth resilience (primary), youth mental health, parental functioning, and the number, duration and types of out-of-home placements. Mediators, moderators, and predictors of effectiveness are examined. Assessments take place at the start of the care program and after three, nine and 15 months. Additionally, semi-structured interviews are conducted with families who have and have not nominated a YIM to understand why some families successfully nominate a YIM, whereas others do not. Discussion: Effective care for youth in multi-problem families is urgently needed. Given its flexibility and accessibility to suit all youth aged 10-23 years from multi-problem families, and its low costs compared to out-of-home placements, the InConnection approach seems an appealing approach to support these families. The current study will provide information on the effectiveness of the InConnection approach. Strengths of this study include its robust design, the ecological validity, and the inclusion of possible mediators, predictors, and moderators of treatment effects.

The development steps from theory to concepts and from empirical data to items are sparsely described in the literature of questionnaire development. Furthermore, there seems to be a need for an instrument measuring quality of life and participation in a population with diverse disabilities. The aim of this paper was to present and discuss the initial steps in the development of the Electronic Quality of Life questionnaire (EQOL). Methods: The development of EQOL included six steps: 1) Establishing conceptual understanding; 2) Development of interview guides which build on the conceptual understanding; 3) Qualitative interviews of 55 participants (10-40 years old) with different types and severities of disabilities; 4) Conceptualization of domains identified in the qualitative data through thematic analysis; 5) Operationalization of the identified domains into items and; 6) Evaluation of content validity of the first version of the EQOL-measure. Content validity was examined by cognitive interviews with participants in the target group as well as by continuous feedback from an advisory board. Results: We identified six domains (function and health, environment (physical and social), social network, wellbeing, occupation, and managing strategies) based on themes derived from the qualitative interviews and on conceptual discussions within the author group. These domains were incorporated in a conceptual model and items were generated to measure the content of each domain. Participants expressed satisfaction with EQOL but most participants felt that there were too many items. Conclusions: In total, 191 items were included in the questionnaire. Participants felt that the EQOL-questionnaire was relevant to their quality of life and participation. We have shown that it is possible to include quality of life and participation for people with various disabilities in one instrument. Although capturing less detail than a condition specific instrument, EQOL includes aspects perceived important for people with disabilities who are not included in general surveys. This is relevant when for example evaluating environmental adaptations and when comparing populations with various disabilities.

J	Heijmans, N; van Lieshout, J; Wensing, M				Heijmans, Naomi; van Lieshout, Jan; Wensing, Michel			Information exchange networks of health care providers and evidence-based cardiovascular risk management: an observational study	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Social network analysis; Evidence-based practice; Primary care; Cardiovascular disease; Implementation science	CHRONIC ILLNESS CARE; SOCIAL NETWORKS; OPINION LEADERS; DISEASE; QUALITY; PROTOCOL; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; IMPACT; TEAMS	Background: Although a wide range of preventive and clinical interventions has targeted cardiovascular risk management (CVRM), outcomes remain suboptimal. Therefore, the question is what additional determinants of CVRM and outcomes can be identified and addressed to optimize CVRM. In this study, we aimed to identify new perspectives for improving healthcare delivery and explored associations between information exchange networks of health care providers and evidence-based CVRM. Methods: This observational study was performed parallel to a randomized clinical trial which aimed to improve professional performance of practice nurses in the Netherlands. Information exchange on medical policy for CVRM ("general information networks") and CVRM for individual patients ("specific information networks") of 180 health professionals in 31 general practices was measured with personalized questionnaires. Medical record audit was performed concerning 1620 patients in these practices to document quality of care delivery and two risk factors (systolic blood pressure (SBP) and LDL cholesterol level). Hypothesized effects of five network characteristics (density, frequency of contact, centrality of CVRM-coordinators, homophily on positive attitudes for treatment target achievement, and presence of an opinion leader for CVRM) constructed on both general and specific information exchange networks were tested and controlled for practice and patient factors using logistic multilevel analyses. Results: Odds for adequate performance were enhanced in practices with an opinion leader for CVRM (OR 2.75, p <.05). Odds for achievement of SBP targets were reduced in practices who had networks with low homophily on positive attitudes for SBP and LDL targets (homophily for SBP targets OR 0.57, p <.05 and OR 0.60, p <.05, homophily for LDL targets OR 0.59, p <.05 and OR 0.61, p <.05 in general and specific information networks, respectively). No effects of network characteristics on cholesterol were found. Conclusions: Delivery of evidence-based CVRM is associated with homophily of clinical attitudes and presence of opinion leaders in primary care teams. These results signal the potential of social networks to be taken into account in further attempts to improve the implementation of evidence-based care for CVRM. Future research is needed to identify and formulate optimal strategies for using opinion leaders to improve CVRM. Future interventions may be more effective if they target a common vision on CVRM within practices.

However, several studies have shown that, in general, there is a significant delay in the adoption of recommendations in such guidelines. Surveys have identified multiple barriers, including clinical inertia, organizational culture/incentives, access to information and peer influence on guideline dissemination and adoption. Although modeling techniques, especially agent-based models, have shown promise, a rigorous computational model for guideline dissemination that incorporates the intricacies of medical decision making and interactions of healthcare workers, and can identify more effective dissemination strategies, is needed. Similar modeling and simulation issues are also prevalent in many other domains such as opinion diffusion, innovation, and technology adoption. In this paper, we introduce a novel overarching computational modeling and simulation framework called the Culturally Infused Agent Based Modeling (CI-ABM) Framework. CI-ABM is a generalizable framework that provides the capability to model a wide range of real-world complex scenarios. To validate the framework, we focus on modeling and analyzing the dissemination of a Type 2 diabetes guideline that recommends individualizing glycemic (A1C) goals. Using existing cross-sectional surveys from physicians across the US, we demonstrate how our methodology for incorporating various socio-cultural and other related factors in agent based models lead to better posterior probability-based analysis and prediction of guideline dissemination behaviors.

Measuring interdependence in ambulatory care	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						ambulatory care; complexity science; health services; measurement; methodology; systems science	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; COMPLEXITY; SYSTEMS; MULTIMORBIDITY; DEPRESSION; MEDICINE; DENSITY	Rationale, aims and objectivesComplex systems differ from complicated systems in that they are nonlinear, unpredictable and lacking clear cause-and-effect relationships, largely due to the interdependence of their components (effects of interconnectedness on system behaviour and consequences). The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the potential for network density to serve as a measure of interdependence, assess its concurrent validity and test whether the use of valued or binary ties yields better results. MethodThis secondary analysis used the 2010 National Ambulatory Care Medical Survey to assess interdependence of top 20' diagnoses seen and medications prescribed for 14 specialties. The degree of interdependence was measured as the level of association between diagnoses and drug interactions among medications. Both valued and binary network densities were computed for each specialty. To assess concurrent validity, these measures were correlated with previously-derived valid measures of complexity of care using the same database, adjusting for diagnosis and medication diversity. ResultsPartial correlations between diagnosis density, and both diagnosis and total input complexity, were significant, as were those between medication density and both medication and total output complexity; for both diagnosis and medication densities, adjusted correlations were higher for binary rather than valued densities. ConclusionThis study demonstrated the feasibility and validity of using network density as a measure of interdependence. When adjusted for measure diversity, density-complexity correlations were significant and higher for binary than valued density. This approach complements other methods of estimating complexity of care and may be applicable to unique settings.

Gamification and nudges have attracted attention as promising strategies to promote changes in health behavior. However, most effectiveness studies thus far lacked active controls, and few studies have tested interventions combining these strategies. Objective: This study investigates the effectiveness of combining a gamified digital app with physical nudges to increase PA and reduce SB in Dutch office workers. Methods: Employees in the municipality of Rotterdam (N=298) from two office locations were randomized at the location level to either a 10-week intervention, combining a 5-week gamification phase encompassing a gamified digital app with social support features and a 5-week physical nudges phase, or to an active control (ie, basic digital app with self-monitoring and goal setting). The primary outcome was the daily step count, objectively measured via accelerometers. Secondary outcomes were self-reported PA and SB measured at baseline and at 5, 10, and 14 weeks. Mixed effects models were used to analyze the effects of the intervention on the outcome measures. Results: A total of 78.5% (234/298) of participants completed the study and provided accelerometer data, whereas 36.9% (110/298) participants completed the self-report measures at 14 weeks. In the gamification phase, step count data were missing for 13.5% (473/3492) of observations in the control and 11.4% (445/3888) in the intervention condition; however, these percentages increased to 39.6% (1154/2910) and 59.6% (1932/3492) at follow-up, respectively. During the gamification phase, intervention participants increased their number of daily steps by 634 (95% CI 154.2-1113.8; P=.01) more than participants in the control group, after controlling for relevant factors. Improvements were not sustained during the physical nudges phase (P=.76) or follow-up (P=.88). Conclusions: A digital intervention with gamification and social support features significantly increased the step count of office workers compared with an active control. Physical nudges in the workplace were insufficient to promote the maintenance of behavioral changes achieved in the gamification phase. Future research should explore the long-term effectiveness of similar gamified digital interventions.

The use of social networking sites such as Facebook for the delivery of health behavior programs is relatively new. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a Web-based beginners' running program for adults aged 18 to 50 years, delivered via a Facebook group, in increasing physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness. Methods: A total of 89 adults with a mean age of 35.2 years (SD 10.9) were recruited online and via print media. Participants were randomly allocated to receive the UniSA Run Free program, an 8-week Web-based beginners' running intervention, delivered via a closed Facebook group (n=41) that included daily interactive posts (information with links, motivational quotes, opinion polls, or questions) and details of the running sessions; or to the control group who received a hard copy of the running program (n=48). Assessments were completed online at baseline, 2 months, and 5 months. The primary outcome measures were self-reported weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness. Secondary outcomes were social support, exercise attitudes, and self-efficacy. Analyses were undertaken using random effects mixed modeling. Compliance with the running program and engagement with the Facebook group were analyzed descriptively. Results: Both groups significantly increased MVPA across the study period (P=.004); however, this was significantly higher in the Facebook group (P=.04). The Facebook group increased their MVPA from baseline by 140 min/week versus 91 min for the control at 2 months. MVPA remained elevated for the Facebook group (from baseline) by 129 min/week versus a 50 min/week decrease for the control at 5 months. Both groups had significant increases in social support scores at 2 months (P=.02); however, there were no group by time differences (P=.16). There were no significant changes in the other outcomes. A process evaluation revealed relatively high levels of engagement with the Facebook group during the 8-week intervention (eg, mean number of interactions 35 [SD 41]). Conclusions: An 8-week beginners' running program delivered through Facebook produced sizable and sustained changes in weekly MVPA and received strong engagement and positive feedback from participants. Future research investigating this intervention approach is warranted in other populations and health behaviors.

Martin			The role of interpersonal communication in the process of knowledge mobilization within a community-based organization: a network analysis	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						diffusion of innovations; network analysis; community-based organization; knowledge mobilization; knowledge translation; interpersonal communication	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY GUIDELINES; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; SOCIAL NETWORK; PUBLIC-HEALTH; TRANSLATION; PREVENTION; DIFFUSION; ADOPTION; SMOKING	Background: Diffusion of innovations theory has been widely used to explain knowledge mobilization of research findings. This theory posits that individuals who are more interpersonally connected within an organization may be more likely to adopt an innovation (e.g., research evidence) than individuals who are less interconnected. Research examining this tenet of diffusion of innovations theory in the knowledge mobilization literature is limited. The purpose of the present study was to use network analysis to examine the role of interpersonal communication in the adoption and mobilization of the physical activity guidelines for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) among staff in a community-based organization (CBO). Methods: The study used a cross-sectional, whole-network design. In total, 56 staff completed the network survey. Adoption of the guidelines was assessed using Rogers' innovation-decision process and interpersonal communication was assessed using an online network instrument. Results: The patterns of densities observed within the network were indicative of a core-periphery structure revealing that interpersonal communication was greater within the core than between the core and periphery and within the periphery. Membership in the core, as opposed to membership in the periphery, was associated with greater knowledge of the evidence-based physical activity resources available and engagement in physical activity promotion behaviours (ps<0.05). Greater in-degree centrality was associated with adoption of evidence-based behaviours (p<0.05). Conclusions: Findings suggest that interpersonal communication is associated with knowledge mobilization and highlight how the network structure could be improved for further dissemination efforts.

However, the multiplicity of sources and flow of data mean that efficient access to useful information and knowledge production has become a major challenge. This challenge can be addressed by taking inspiration from Web 2.0 and particularly social networks, which are at the forefront of big data exploration and human-data interaction. Objective: MyGeneFriends is a Web platform inspired by social networks, devoted to genetic disease analysis, and organized around three types of proactive agents: genes, humans, and genetic diseases. The aim of this study was to improve exploration and exploitation of biological, postgenomic era big data. Methods: MyGeneFriends leverages conventions popularized by top social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc), such as networks of friends, profile pages, friendship recommendations, affinity scores, news feeds, content recommendation, and data visualization. Results: MyGeneFriends provides simple and intuitive interactions with data through evaluation and visualization of connections (friendships) between genes, humans, and diseases. The platform suggests new friends and publications and allows agents to follow the activity of their friends. It dynamically personalizes information depending on the user's specific interests and provides an efficient way to share information with collaborators. Furthermore, the user's behavior itself generates new information that constitutes an added value integrated in the network, which can be used to discover new connections between biological agents. Conclusions: We have developed MyGeneFriends, a Web platform leveraging conventions from popular social networks to redefine the relationship between humans and biological big data and improve human processing of biomedical data.

This review sought to gain an understanding of the broker role of clinician-scientists. Method The authors conducted a realist review to describe context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations associated with the broker role of clinician-scientists. CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase were searched between May and August 2017. Data were analyzed qualitatively; data synthesis focused on assembling CMO configurations. Results Of an initial 2,241 articles, 9 were included in the final review. Included papers show that clinician-scientists, in their broker role, achieve 2 organizational-level outcomes: an increased volume of clinically relevant, research, and increased evidence application to improve care. They also achieve the individual-level outcome of professional development as a researcher, clinician, and broker. Multidimensional skills and management support are necessary context factors. Mechanisms that contribute to outcomes include balancing economic and scientific interests and performing boundary-crossing activities. Four CMO configurations by which clinician-scientists achieve outcomes in brokering a connection between research and practice were identified. Useful program theories for explaining these are boundary crossing, social network, communities of practice, and diffusion of innovation theory. Conclusions The mechanisms found may provide insight for interventions aiming to support clinician-scientists in their broker role. The authors expect that if more attention is paid to learning multidimensional skills and management support for the broker role is strengthened, stronger links between research and practice could be forged.

A minority of patients with advanced or metastatic gynecologic cancer utilize palliative care and lack of knowledge may be a barrier to receiving palliative care services. Objectives. To identify sources used by patients with advanced or metastatic gynecologic cancer to learn about palliative care and evaluate for differences in knowledge about palliative care and palliative care utilization by knowledge source. Methods. Patients with gynecologic cancer receiving treatment for advanced or metastatic gynecologic cancer at a single academic medical center were surveyed about their awareness of and knowledge about palliative care. Medical chart review was conducted. Results. Of the 111 women surveyed, 70 had heard of palliative care (63%). Sixty-eight specified from where they learned of palliative care: cancer care (n = 28; 41.2%), word of mouth (n = 26; 38.2%), work (n = 6; 8.8%), self-education (n = 4; 5.9%), personal experience (n = 2; 2.9%), or do not know (n = 2; 2.9%). Knowledge about palliative care (P = 0.35) and palliative care utilization (P = 0.81) did not differ by awareness of palliative care. Conclusion. Most women receiving treatment for advanced gynecologic cancer have heard of palliative care from sources other than their cancer care providers. Knowledge about palliative care and source of knowledge about palliative care were not associated with palliative care utilization. Awareness of palliative care and palliative care utilization may be improved by increasing the low rate of health provider-based education and engaging cancer patients' social networks.

Experience of Symptoms and Disease Impact in Patients with Adenomyosis	PATIENT-PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH			English	Article							CONTENT VALIDITY; REPORTED OUTCOMES; PRO INSTRUMENTS; WOMENS LIVES; ENDOMETRIOSIS; PREVALENCE	Background Adenomyosis is a poorly understood, benign disease of the uterus. Objective In this study, patient interviews were conducted to characterize the symptoms and impact of adenomyosis. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which women with adenomyosis were recruited from five US clinics and a health-related social network forum. Participants (aged 18-55 years) were pre-menopausal with a history of regular menstrual cycles. Participants were interviewed about their experiences with adenomyosis, symptoms and impacts on day-to-day activities (concept elicitation), and subsequently about the occurrence, relative severity, and impact of symptoms (card-sorting exercise). Results In total, 31 women were interviewed. Mean duration since onset of first adenomyosis symptom was 5.7 years; 41.9% reported severe/very severe adenomyosis. Over 50 symptoms and 30 impacts of adenomyosis were reported in the concept elicitation; 87% of symptoms were reported after 7 interviews and 78% of impacts after 5 interviews, indicating a condition with a significant symptom burden and a consistent presentation. The most common symptoms were heavy menstrual bleeding (87%), cramps (84%), and blood clots during menstrual bleeding (84%). The most common impacts were burdensome self-care hygiene (71%), and fatigue/low energy (71%). In the card-sorting exercise, the most commonly endorsed symptoms were pain during menstruation/menstrual cramps and heavy menstrual bleeding (both frequently rated as severe). The symptom with the highest impact was heavy menstrual bleeding. Conclusion Initiatives to understand women's experiences with adenomyosis may improve management of the condition. This study provides a first step in understanding their experience and new information on the symptom profile of adenomyosis.

The antecedents are physicians' attitude toward knowledge sharing and interactivity perception (about CDSS) and the outcomes are performance expectancy and intention to adopt CDSS. Besides, we include (1) the antecedents of attitude toward knowledge sharing subjective norms, social factors and OCB (helping behavior) and (2) roles of physicians' involvement in decision making, computer self-efficacy and effort expectancy in our framework. Methods: Data from a stratified sample of 335 Malaysian physicians working in 12 public and private hospitals in Malaysia were collected to test the hypotheses using Structural Equation Modeling (S EM). Results: The important findings of our research are: (1) factors such as perceived threat to professional autonomy, performance expectancy, and physicians' involvement in making decision about CDSS have significant impact on physicians' intention to adopt CDSS; (2) physicians' attitude toward knowledge sharing, interactivity perception and computer self-efficacy of physicians play a crucial role in influencing their perceived threat to professional autonomy; and (3) social network, shared goals and OCB (helping behavior) impact physicians' attitude toward knowledge sharing.

QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Attrition; Elderly; Panel survey; Subjective well-being; Satisfaction	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SAMPLE ATTRITION; SOCIAL NETWORK; BIAS; LONELINESS; HEALTH; PREDICTORS; DECLINE; SCALE; NONRESPONSE	Purpose The increased population aging has resulted in a growing need for longitudinal studies about the quality of life among older people. Nevertheless, the results of these investigations could be biased because more disadvantaged people leave the original sample. The purpose of this study is to examine how the selective attrition observed in a panel survey affect multivariate models of subjective well-being (SWB). The question is if we could do reliable longitudinal investigations concerning the predictors of SWB in old age. Methods This paper examines attrition in a panel of older people in Chile. Attrition was evaluated in the variables that affect elderly SWB. Probit models were fitted to compare dropouts with nondropouts. Then, multivariate probit models were estimated on satisfaction and depressive symptoms, comparing dropouts and nondropouts. Finally, we compared weighted and unweighted multivariate probit models on SWB. Results The attrition rate in 2 years was 38.8%, including deaths and 32.9%, excluding them. Survey dropouts had lower satisfaction but not higher depressive symptoms. Among SWB predictors, people without a partner and with lower self-efficacy abandoned more the study. When applying the Becketti, Gould, Lillard, and Welch test, the probit coefficients of the predictor variables on SWB outcome variables were similar for dropouts and nondropouts. Finally, the comparison of multivariate models on SWB with weighting methods did not find substantial differences in the explanatory coefficients. Conclusion Although some predictors of attrition were associated with SWB, attrition did not produce biased estimates in multivariate models of life satisfaction life or depressive symptoms in old age.

J	Qian, YX; Gui, WX; Ma, FC; Dong, QX				Qian, Yuxing; Gui, Wenxuan; Ma, Feicheng; Dong, Qingxing			Exploring features of social support in a Chinese online smoking cessation community: A multidimensional content analysis of user interaction data	HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL			English	Article						online health community; social support; smoking cessation; online user behavior; content analysis	QUIT SMOKING; INTERVENTION; INTERNET; MODEL	Due to the rapid development of information technology, an increasing number of smokers choose online smoking cessation communities to interact with other individuals to help themselves quit smoking. Though it is well known that social support plays a key role in the process of smoking cessation, the features of social support that one can get from online smoking cessation communities remain unclear. We collected user interaction data from the largest Chinese online smoking cessation community, the quit smoking forum of Baidu Tieba. We selected 2758 replies from 29 active repliers and 408 correlated posts as our data set. Multidimensional content analysis is carried out from three aspects: posting scenarios, user quitting behavior stages, and types of social support. This article also explores the co-occurrence relationships of different types of social support by social network analysis. Results showed that users receive different compositions of social support in various posting scenarios and behavior stages. In most cases, emotional support is the most typical support the community provides. The community will provide more informational support when needed. Besides, informational support, especially personal experience and perceptual knowledge, has more diverse combination patterns with other types of social support. "Gratitude-Mutual assistance" and "Encouragement-Mutual assistance" are the most frequent co-occurrence relationships. The online smoking cessation community brings people who quit smoking together, and users provide rich types of social support for each other. Users can effectively obtain expected social support in different posting scenarios and smoking cessation stages. Smoking cessation projects should be designed to promote user communication and interaction, which positively affects achieving users' smoking cessation goals.

Recent cancer care guidelines recommend discussing life goals as part of patient-provider communication. The goal of this study was to understand patients' attitudes toward goal sharing with their cancer care providers. Patients and methods Semi-structured questionnaires were conducted via email with cancer patients and survivors (n = 39) on an online social network called Smart Patients. Participants answered open-ended questions about their life goals. They then completed a survey regarding their attitudes toward goal sharing with healthcare providers. The study team used an integrated inductive-deductive qualitative analysis to identify conceptual themes. Results Participants listed goals related to improving physical activity, control, enjoyment/leisure, and inner strength while reducing pain, anxiety, fear of recurrence, and uncertainty. Most of these goals were life goals rather than goals specifically related to medical care. Across all goals, there was a focus on returning to normality. Our findings show that 87% of participants expect their cancer specialist to discuss their treatment preferences and goals regularly with them. However, participants were reluctant to share their goals with their providers. Respondents felt that their providers did not have an interest in their life goals or time to address them in addition to their medical treatment. Conclusion Even though cancer patient-provider communication guidelines advocate for discussions around life goals, participants in this study expressed reluctance to share life goals with providers. Further efforts to align expectations of patients and providers may facilitate adherence to cancer communication guidelines about life goals. Implications for cancer survivors Cancer survivors should be aware that discussing life goals is part of recommended communication with their cancer care teams.
